Here are some of the common types of WordPress meetups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hang out and work on your WordPress sites together</li>\n<li>Social/happy hour type gatherings</li>\n<li>Mini-lectures/presentations</li>\n<li>Developer hacking meetups</li>\n<li>Show &amp; tell of how group members are using WordPress</li>\n<li>Formal instruction on how to use WordPress</li>\n<li>Lecture series (possibly with visiting speakers)</li>\n<li>Genius bar/help desk</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no prescribed format, as each local group can decide for itself what they want to do. Some groups mix it up from month to month, while others have multiple events each month to satisfy the needs of their community.</p>\n<p>The tough part? Running a popular group takes time and money. Just as we worked last year to remove the financial burden for <a href=\"http://wordcamp.org\">WordCamp</a> organizers and provide logistical support so they could focus more on their event content and experience, we want to start extending that kind of support to meetup groups as well. We don&#8217;t want it to cost anything for someone to run a WordPress meetup, or to attend one &#8212; building local communities should be as free as WordPress itself!</p>\n<p>Since there are so many more meetups than there are WordCamps, we&#8217;re going to start with the cost that is the same for every group: meetup.com organizer dues. We&#8217;re setting up an official WordPress account on <a href=\"http://Meetup.com\">Meetup.com</a> right now, and over the next couple of weeks will be working with existing meetup group organizers, people who want to start a new meetup group, and the helpful folks at Meetup.com to put this program in place. WordPress meetup groups that choose to have their group become part of the WordPress account will no longer pay organizer dues for that group, as the <a href=\"http://wordpressfoundation.org\">WordPress Foundation</a> will be footing the bill.</p>\n<p>This is exciting for several reasons. First, it means local organizers who are giving something back to the project by way of their time won&#8217;t also have shell out $12-19/month for the privilege. That alone is a big step. Second, it will open the door to more events and leaders within a community, since leadership and event planning won&#8217;t need to be tied to &#8220;owning&#8221; the meetup group. Third, more active meetup groups means more WordCamps, yay!</p>\n<p>In addition to the financial aspects, we&#8217;ll be working on ways to improve social recognition of meetup activity by incorporating feeds from the official meetup groups into the WordPress.org site, and including meetup group participation in the activity stream on your <a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/\">WordPress.org profile</a>.<sup>2</sup> I&#8217;m also hoping we can do something around providing video equipment to meetup groups (like we already do for WordCamps) to record presentations and tutorials that can be posted to <a href=\"http://WordPress.tv\">WordPress.tv</a>, helping meetup groups offer WordPress classes in their community, and getting involved with mentoring WordPress clubs at local schools and universities. Oh, and we&#8217;ll send out some WordPress buttons and stickers to the groups that join in, because everyone loves buttons and stickers.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re also putting together some cool resources for people who want to start a new meetup group.

Check out this short video that summarizes the things we think you&#8217;ll find are the cat&#8217;s pajamas:</p>\n<div id=\"v-I7NAw9Zk-1\" class=\"video-player\"><embed id=\"v-I7NAw9Zk-1-video\" src=\"http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=I7NAw9Zk&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"692\" height=\"388\" title=\"Introducing WordPress 3.3 &quot;Sonny&quot;\" wmode=\"direct\" seamlesstabbing=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" overstretch=\"true\"></embed></div>\n<h3>For Users</h3>\n<p>Experienced users will appreciate the new <strong>drag-and-drop uploader</strong>, hover menus for the navigation, the new toolbar, improved co-editing support, and the new Tumblr importer. We&#8217;ve also been thinking a ton about what the WordPress experience is like for people completely new to the software. Version 3.3 has significant improvements there with<strong> pointer tips</strong> for new features included in each update, a friendly welcome message for first-time users, and revamped help tabs throughout the interface. Finally we&#8217;ve improved the dashboard experience on the iPad and other tablets with better touch support.</p>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>There is a ton of candy for developers as well. I&#8217;d recommend starting your exploration with the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_editor\">new editor API</a>, new jQuery version, better ways to hook into the help screens, more performant post-slug-only permalinks, and of course the entire list of improvements <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.3\">on the Codex</a> and <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.3\">in Trac</a>.</p>\n<h3>Roll the Credits</h3>\n<p>The Credits tab on the new About WordPress screen in the WordPress dashboard provides recognition for contributors to each release, but we like to thank them here as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/aaroncampbell\">Aaron D.

Check out this short video that summarizes the things we think you&#8217;ll find are the cat&#8217;s pajamas:</p>\n<div id=\"v-I7NAw9Zk-1\" class=\"video-player\"><embed id=\"v-I7NAw9Zk-1-video\" src=\"http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=I7NAw9Zk&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"692\" height=\"388\" title=\"Introducing WordPress 3.3 &quot;Sonny&quot;\" wmode=\"direct\" seamlesstabbing=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" overstretch=\"true\"></embed></div>\n<h3>For Users</h3>\n<p>Experienced users will appreciate the new <strong>drag-and-drop uploader</strong>, hover menus for the navigation, the new toolbar, improved co-editing support, and the new Tumblr importer. We&#8217;ve also been thinking a ton about what the WordPress experience is like for people completely new to the software. Version 3.3 has significant improvements there with<strong> pointer tips</strong> for new features included in each update, a friendly welcome message for first-time users, and revamped help tabs throughout the interface. Finally we&#8217;ve improved the dashboard experience on the iPad and other tablets with better touch support.</p>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>There is a ton of candy for developers as well. I&#8217;d recommend starting your exploration with the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_editor\">new editor API</a>, new jQuery version, better ways to hook into the help screens, more performant post-slug-only permalinks, and of course the entire list of improvements <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.3\">on the Codex</a> and <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.3\">in Trac</a>.</p>\n<h3>Roll the Credits</h3>\n<p>The Credits tab on the new About WordPress screen in the WordPress dashboard provides recognition for contributors to each release, but we like to thank them here as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/aaroncampbell\">Aaron D.

been awhile since we&#8217;ve had a discussion revolving around those three magic letters GPL. It looks like we&#8217;ll be talking about it again considering that <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtlrJLahvLsCdGVEMVpRSWNIdVBKVDVaSlJqSkRlbWc#gid=0\"><del datetime=\"2012-02-23T16:37:36+00:00\">somewhere around 500 plugins</a> run the risk of being purged due to their incompatibility with GPLv2</del>. There has been an <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16898\">ongoing discussion</a> within the past 11 months regarding various licenses and what is and is not compatible with what WordPress uses. It looks like the core team has been monitoring the discussion considering Andrew Nacins comment:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The core team plans to discuss plugin directory licensing once none of us are sick or traveling. So, expect an update here in the next week or so.</p>\n<p>The arguments have been laid out, so no need to continue to do so. Not trying to stifle discussion, but, you have all made your points. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Jane Wells also participated in the tract ticket discussion:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I would think we would want everything on wordpress.org to have consistent and compatible licensing. If we&#8217;ve moved away from that, is Matt aware of it? (I wasn&#8217;t.)

There has been an <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16898\">ongoing discussion</a> within the past 11 months regarding various licenses and what is and is not compatible with what WordPress uses. It looks like the core team has been monitoring the discussion considering Andrew Nacins comment:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The core team plans to discuss plugin directory licensing once none of us are sick or traveling. So, expect an update here in the next week or so.</p>\n<p>The arguments have been laid out, so no need to continue to do so. Not trying to stifle discussion, but, you have all made your points. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Jane Wells also participated in the tract ticket discussion:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I would think we would want everything on wordpress.org to have consistent and compatible licensing.

Then, I started searching around at the various WordPress commercial themes and noticed quite a few that looked like they would be perfect for the site. However, when I purchased the theme and tried to apply my vision, it never seemed to work out.

I was well settled in Hyderabad so I bought a bike there.\r\nUnder some uncertain situation I permanently transferred to Mumbai office,  so I took my bike with me\r\nto Mumbai and in few months I moved to Pune since I changed my job. As these were pretty quick moves, I didn\'t get a chance to get NOC for the bike before moving out of Hyderabad.\r\nBefore moving out, though in vain, I tried to get information about getting an NOC but didn\'t get useful information on the internet. The other sources misled me into believing that NOC is not required, so I was clueless and was happily riding my bike on the streets of Pune.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nUntil one fine day, a Traffic policeman stopped me and asked for NOC. I didnt have it and he asked me to pay road tax which was Rs.4000. Obviously I couldn\'t pay that much for a small mistake (\"seemingly small\") or thing which I didn\'t know. However I settled the issue by paying him whatever money I had in my wallet (I guess, some 300 rupees). Since then I started the quest of knowing the process of getting NOC so that I can peacefully ride my bike in city.\r\n\r\nI was only left with 2 options either to sell this bike in Hyd or to obtain NOC. I didnt want to sell the bike as I loved it.\r\nMy friend in Hyderabad asked one RTO agent to do this task for me but he failed to do so. There was no option but to try it myself. I went to Hyderabad with my bike and underwent the process to obtain the NOC. After lots of rounds to various police stations and RTO offices due to wrong information, I finally got the NOC.\r\n\r\nSo here is my attempt to  throw some light on the procedure to get NOC.\r\nThe procedure is as follows:\r\n\r\n1) Get a clearance certificate from traffic police - 1 day(2-3 hrs)\r\n-- need to go to police control room, near Nampalli, Hyderabad\r\n-- police were very helpful and nice there.\r\n-- no money\r\n2) Getting the challan from E-seva office\r\n-- need a xerox of RC book\r\n-- you should know that under which police station area, your address on RC card comes since you need to mention those details on the form to be submitted to E-seva office.\r\n-- knowing Telugu will help (knowing the local language always helps)\r\n-- Rs. 100 for Hyderabad and Rs 200 for Cyberabad\r\n\r\n3) E-seva people will courier this request to police station next day\r\n-- to speed-up the process, you can get the form signed from Eseva officer and take it to police station yourself. (I did this)\r\n\r\n4) Police station people will call you once they get forms from Eseva people\r\nthey will call you for verification,\r\n-- to speed-up the process, you can also go to that Police station and ask for your form, if you want to speed up process.\r\n-- dont expect much assistance here\r\n-- they might ask you for money\r\n-- knowing Telugu will help\r\n\r\n5) In some cases,they will forward this request to ACP office for that police station\r\n6) ACP office will forward this request to Police headquarters.\r\n7) Finally you need to get the no objection certificate from Crime branch, Police\r\n8) Then you need to go to RTO for getting NOC from RTA.\r\nDocuments needed\r\n- RC book\r\n- Insurance\r\n- PUC\r\n- Police Clearance\r\n- Traffic police clearance\r\n- here it takes 2 days, if requested they will do it in a single working day.\r\n\r\nIt took me 5 working days inspite of doing everthing myself (I didn\'t wait for E-seva to courier it, I myself took the signed form to the police station) , without this urgency it should take at max 2 weeks, as police verification requires atleast 1 week.\r\n\r\nI would like to dedicate this post to some people I met during this visit, and without whose help this work would not have possible at all. I dont know their names.\r\nBut I think I wont forget them.\r\nI will call them \"few good men (and women)\", people I am mentioning are the ladies at Eseva office at Kukatpalli, then officer at Cyberabad police HQ and officer at Attapur RTA.

I was well settled in Hyderabad, I bought a bike.\r\nUnder some uncertain situation I permanently transferred to Mumbai office,  So I took my bike with me\r\nto Mumbai and in few months I moved to Pune, changed my job. As they were pretty quick moves, I didnt get chance to get NOC for bike before moving outside of Hyderabad.\r\nand even before move, In vain, I tried to get information about NOC but didnt get useful information on internet and other sources misled me into believing that NOC is not required. so I was clueless  and was happily driving my Bike on streets of Pune. Until one fine day, a Traffic policeman stopped me and asked for NOC. I didnt have it and he asked me to pay road tax which was 4000 Rs. Obviously I cant pay that much for small mistake or thing which I didnt know. I settled this issue with paying him whatever money I had in my purse (I guess, some 300 Rs). so since then I started quest of knowing process of getting NOC. so that I can peacefully drive my bike in city.\r\n\r\nI was only left with 2 options either to sell this bike in Hyd or to obtain NOC. I didnt want to sell the bike as I loved it.\r\nThrough my friend in Hyderabad I asked one RTO agent to this task for me. but He failed to do so. There was no option to\r\ntry myself so I tried doing this task. I went to hyderabad with my bike. and underwent process for the NOC and able to\r\nget NOC with lots of rounds to various police stations/ rto offices due to wrong information.\r\n\r\nso here is my attemp to  throw some light on NOC procedure.\r\nThe procedure is as follows..\r\n\r\n1) Get a clearance certificate from traffic police - 1 day(2-3 hrs)\r\n-- need to go to police control room, near nampalli, hyderabad\r\n-- police were very helpful and nice there.\r\n-- no money\r\n2) getting challan from E-seva office\r\n-- need a xerox of RC book\r\n-- you should know that under which police station area, your address on RC card comes.  you need to write on form to be submitted to E-seva office.\r\n-- knowing telugu will help\r\n-- 100 Rs for hyderabad and 200 Rs for cyberabad\r\n\r\n3) Eseva people will courier this request to police station next day\r\n-- to speed-up the process, you can get the form signed from Eseva officer and take it to police station by hand. (I did this)\r\n\r\n4) Police station people will call you once they get forms from Eseva people\r\nthey will call you for verification,\r\n-- to speed-up the process,You can also go to that Police station and ask for your form, if you want to speed up process.\r\n-- dont expect much assistance here\r\n-- they might ask you for money\r\n-- knowing telugu will help\r\n\r\n5) In some cases,they will forward this request to ACP office for that police station\r\n6) ACP office will forward this request to Police head quarter.\r\n7) Finally you need to get the no objection certificate from Crime branch, Police\r\n8) Then you need to go to RTO for getting NOC from RTA.\r\nDocuments needed\r\n- RC book\r\n- Insurance\r\n- PUC\r\n- Police Clearance\r\n- traffic police clearance\r\n- here it takes 2 days, if requested they will do it in Single working day.\r\n\r\nit took me 5 working days with doing it manually, without this urgency it should take atmax 2 weeks. as police verification requires atleast 1 week.\r\n\r\nI would like to dedicate this post to some people I met during this visit, and without whose help this work would not have possible at all.

I asked my colleagues, some said it was easy, some said I have to be careful with agents and some said it isn’t worth all the effort that we put in.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">I got all sorts of information but didn’t get the right procedure or say the real picture. Now here started the journey to the unexplored. I called up my Insurance agent at the around 11 pm one night and asked him that it was a Corporate medical insurance, so what would be the ideal way to go about it.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\"><!--more--></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Okay I say “go about it” and not “claiming it” because you do not necessarily claim the money when you have a medical or health insurance.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">There are two ways to “go about it”; I was enlightened, which are as follows:</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\"><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;\">Cashless</span></strong><span style=\"font-size: small;\">- You can avail this method only if you are getting the patient admitted to one of hospitals that have a tie up with your Insurance Company.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">This is the roughly the procedure. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Our doctor suggested surgery. He said he would want to operate my mother on the following Monday. He said that the whole expense would be approximately Rs. 50,000. I had roughly one and a half day at hand. I was not tensed, I will tell you the reason after I tell you about the pre-surgery insurance formalities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0in;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Doctor has to sign the cashless claim form and write about the illness, the line of treatment and the purpose of surgery.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In this whole procedure the <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">Cashless card</strong> <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">is a must</strong>.

However when I went to submit the form I realized the person in charge of it was not there for the day, yet I was given the assurance that things would be looked after. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Even after the assurance, I got the toll free number and the person on charge of the Hospital insurance wing. I kept on calling both the places and understood that either one of them was not being sincere. The hospital kept on telling me that they have faxed the form and Insurance Company kept on telling me that they haven’t.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The next day was Sunday. All the administrative offices in the hospital remained closed that day. My mother was to be operated early morning; I paid Rs. 10,000 as security so that the doctors could at least start. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.25in;\"><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Moral: Get the cashless approval well in time to avoid paying the security deposit which you will face trouble to get back from the hospital authorities.</span></span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">It was a conservative surgery and we could take mom back home the same day. Now we faced the real trial.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The hospital bill was in total Rs.66, 627. It wasn’t that big a deal. I called up my Insurance agent for the nth time that day and he told me that if I don’t get the formalities done within 5 pm in the evening, we would have tough time. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The hospital would not keep the patient because it would have prepared the final bill, neither would they let release her since they would not get the Insurance Claim approval from the Insurance Company after the regular working hours.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">So here started the running around from the doctor’s cabin to the Insurance wing to my mother’s ward. The doctor had too many patients to take care of (understandable), yet he came for his regular ward visits and Okayed mom for discharge. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The discharge approval was sent to the Insurance wing and then after approximately 50 odd calls to the Insurance Company Call Center and bickering with the Insurance wing of the hospital, we finally received the fax approving the Rs.66,000. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Health Insurance or medical Insurance only covers expenses related to the health.

I was well settled in Hyderabad so I bought a bike there.\r\nUnder some uncertain situation I permanently transferred to Mumbai office,  so I took my bike with me\r\nto Mumbai and in few months I moved to Pune since I changed my job. As these were pretty quick moves, I didn\'t get a chance to get NOC for the bike before moving out of Hyderabad.\r\nBefore moving out, though in vain, I tried to get information about getting an NOC but didn\'t get useful information on the internet. The other sources misled me into believing that NOC is not required, so I was clueless and was happily riding my bike on the streets of Pune.\r\n\r\nUntil one fine day, a Traffic policeman stopped me and asked for NOC. I didnt have it and he asked me to pay road tax which was Rs.4000. Obviously I couldn\'t pay that much for a small mistake (\"seemingly small\") or thing which I didn\'t know. However I settled the issue by paying him whatever money I had in my wallet (I guess, some 300 rupees). Since then I started the quest of knowing the process of getting NOC so that I can peacefully ride my bike in city.\r\n\r\nI was only left with 2 options either to sell this bike in Hyd or to obtain NOC. I didnt want to sell the bike as I loved it.\r\nMy friend in Hyderabad asked one RTO agent to do this task for me but he failed to do so. There was no option but to try it myself. I went to Hyderabad with my bike and underwent the process to obtain the NOC. After lots of rounds to various police stations and RTO offices due to wrong information, I finally got the NOC.\r\n\r\nSo here is my attempt to  throw some light on the procedure to get NOC.\r\nThe procedure is as follows:\r\n\r\n1) Get a clearance certificate from traffic police - 1 day(2-3 hrs)\r\n-- need to go to police control room, near Nampalli, Hyderabad\r\n-- police were very helpful and nice there.\r\n-- no money\r\n2) Getting the challan from E-seva office\r\n-- need a xerox of RC book\r\n-- you should know that under which police station area, your address on RC card comes since you need to mention those details on the form to be submitted to E-seva office.\r\n-- knowing Telugu will help (knowing the local language always helps)\r\n-- Rs. 100 for Hyderabad and Rs 200 for Cyberabad\r\n\r\n3) E-seva people will courier this request to police station next day\r\n-- to speed-up the process, you can get the form signed from Eseva officer and take it to police station yourself. (I did this)\r\n\r\n4) Police station people will call you once they get forms from Eseva people\r\nthey will call you for verification,\r\n-- to speed-up the process, you can also go to that Police station and ask for your form, if you want to speed up process.\r\n-- dont expect much assistance here\r\n-- they might ask you for money\r\n-- knowing Telugu will help\r\n\r\n5) In some cases,they will forward this request to ACP office for that police station\r\n6) ACP office will forward this request to Police headquarters.\r\n7) Finally you need to get the no objection certificate from Crime branch, Police\r\n8) Then you need to go to RTO for getting NOC from RTA.\r\nDocuments needed\r\n- RC book\r\n- Insurance\r\n- PUC\r\n- Police Clearance\r\n- Traffic police clearance\r\n- here it takes 2 days, if requested they will do it in a single working day.\r\n\r\nIt took me 5 working days inspite of doing everthing myself (I didn\'t wait for E-seva to courier it, I myself took the signed form to the police station) , without this urgency it should take at max 2 weeks, as police verification requires atleast 1 week.\r\n\r\nI would like to dedicate this post to some people I met during this visit, and without whose help this work would not have possible at all. I dont know their names.\r\nBut I think I wont forget them.\r\nI will call them \"few good men (and women)\", people I am mentioning are the ladies at Eseva office at Kukatpalli, then officer at Cyberabad police HQ and officer at Attapur RTA. Seeing these people do good work, my belief in good people philosophy further strengthened.  And it also redoubled my own enthusiasm to work with dedication, honesty and hardwork.\r\n\r\nSo hats of \"few good men (and women)\" :)','No objection certificate for vehicle transfer',0,'No objection certificate for vehicle transfer in hyderabad, Andhra pradesh ','inherit','open','open','','19-revision-6','','','2008-12-04 03:28:52','2008-12-04 10:28:52','',19,'http://www.rightprocedure.com/?p=67',0,'revision','',0),(68,3,'2008-12-03 14:45:55','2008-12-03 21:45:55','<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"highslide-image\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this, {captionId:\'caption_1228340546883\'});\" href=\"http://www.rightprocedure.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/rightWay.gif\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"http://www.rightprocedure.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/rightWay.gif\" alt=\"image\"  style=\"height: 150px;\"/></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"caption_1228340546883\" class=\"highslide-caption\">Right Way...</div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">At Right Procedure, We are going to try our best to put out information, which will give people first hand information abt tasks, give them initial cues and if possible, key contact details,\r\nto start doing things.

I kept on calling both the places and understood that either one of them was not being sincere.

All the administrative offices in the hospital remained closed that day. My mother was to be operated early morning; I paid Rs. 10,000 as security so that the doctors could at least start. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.25in;\"><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Moral: Get the cashless approval well in time to avoid paying the security deposit which you will face trouble to get back from the hospital authorities.</span></span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: small; font-family: Calibri;\">It was a conservative surgery and we could take mom back home the same day.

When its sensitive thing like filing of one\'s income tax returns, you want to be extra cautious as generally its not advisable to share your finances with some other person when you can do it yourself.\r\n\r\nSince last two years, I was trying to file income tax returns online using Indian income tax departments website, I used to start quite enthusiastically but ends up in unsuccessful attempt. as the process was quite complex, most of the terms were unknown to me. I always believed that they should outsource it to someone. and In the end I used to outsource it to some CA.\r\n\r\nThis month we have to file income tax returns, I was in Noida away from so. I was thinking of sending documents Form16 back home and ask my brother to file returns through some CA. but may be the, Hope is the best thing in the world.  I turned to Google and searched for online filing in India.  I got to <a href=\"http://taxsmile.com\">Taxsmile</a>\r\n\r\nWebsite looked good, so I thought I would give a try as It looked better to me than kind of time I spend in Indian income tax website understanding things. I registered. registration process was simple.\r\n\r\nafter logging in, It looks very obvious process, they took me stap by step. taking personal information first.\r\n\r\nthen taking me to form where I can fill my tax details it was quite simple, exactly similler to my Form 16.\r\n\r\nI found everything pretty easy. I opted for digital signature. I just need to take application form from TaxSmile, paste photo on it and  attach PAN card xerox, address proof xerox to it. and I am done.\r\n\r\naddition to filing normal returns on Tax deduction at source on salary , it also asks for incomes from other sources like Stocks, MFs, Bank Account interests and calculates tax for you which is not included in Form 16 given  by your company and helps you to file IT returns properly and correctly to save you from future headaches.\r\n\r\nThey have good FAQ and interesting planning tools to calculate taxes.\r\n\r\nevery system has some flaws so this one too have. Actually getting documents attested is pretty good headache, instead one will go to CA. purpose of online filing, if one understand, is to do everything online and no paper work. so I think somehow they should remove this documents thing.\r\n\r\nI was getting sms\'s from MyItReturn.com, claiming they would file your income tax in 15 minutes but again\r\n\r\nthey have adoption problem, you need to download a ITR-V form and need to submit it to incometax office yourself which is kind of painful. if you anyway have to go to Income tax office, you can file your returns there directly.\r\n\r\nso still online filing of returns has scope of lots of improvement.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: This site is not anyway related to or benefitted from Taxsmile directly or indirectly.

Being an Indian citizen you need it for filing your tax returns, and mandatory for any high value financial transaction, in equity market and In many cases can be used as Identity card.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">There are 3 ways to get a PAN card - Firstly one can contact any agent (mostly he is the person who handle your tax related matters) Secondly one apply for PAN card online and pay the amount online thru credit card, Demand Draft or thru Cheque and third-way is do it traditional way i.e. fill the form yourself and submit it.</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">If you decide on applying for pan card online then <a title=\"Application for PAN through Online Services\" href=\"https://tin.tin.nsdl.com/pan/index.html \" target=\"_blank\">this site</a> should help you for the same. There you can find how to apply for new PAN, reprint of PAN card, Correction in PAN details, Status track for PAN application</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Thirdly if you want to fill the application yourself and submit it then next few suggestion should be helpful for you - Firstly you need to get the PAN application form i.e. FORM49A One can get it form any income Tax department, IT services department, or any INCOME TAX PAN SERVICES UNIT i.e. any UTIISL centers which are sub centers been outsourced by the IT department. OR one can download the form <a title=\"Downloadables PAN\" href=\"http://www.tin-nsdl.com/DownloadsPAN.asp\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">The Main points one should keep in mind while filling up the IT form is <strong>it should be filled in capitals, </strong>as a proof one should attach<strong> Proof of Identity </strong>i.e. any identification proof having photo and is authorized. For that you can attach<strong> Drivers License photo copy, college ID, or work ID. </strong>Then<strong> </strong>you have to attach<strong> photocopy of any address proof like ration card, Telephone/electricity bill in your name. And two photographs.</strong></li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">One will also need to write ward number/range/income tax assessing officer number (which you can find from the copy of the acknowledgement of the last return filed.) If you do not have that, you will have to ask your income tax department in your city, and they will give you the ward number on the form. This <a title=\"Services :: PAN :: AO Code\" href=\"http://www.tin-nsdl.com/PANaocode.asp\" target=\"_blank\">site </a> may help you for further assistance.</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">After filling the form hardest part is finding the office where to fill the form. Not all the IT offices accept the forms. I am attaching the following link which should help you locate the nearest IT Service Center near your city.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">One thing you should bear in mind if you happen to submit the FORM49A at any IT Service Center run by UTIISL then you need to buy the forms from there itself as those form have a serial numbers and they wont accept any forms which does not have their series number printed on them. All forms downloaded does not have the series number.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Helpful links:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a title=\"Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, Government of India\" href=\" http://www.incometaxindia.gov.in\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Department of India</a></div></li>\r\n	<li>\r\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a title=\"UTI Technology Services Limited - UTITSL Home\" href=\"http://%3ca%20href=%22http/www.utiisl.co.in/%22%3E%3CFONT%20face=%22Times%20New%20Roman%22%20size=3%3Ehttp:/www.utiisl.co.in\" target=\"_blank\">UTI Technology Services</a></div></li>\r\n	<li>\r\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a title=\"A repository of nationwide tax related information\" href=\" http://www.incometaxindia.gov.in\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Information Network (TIN)</a></div></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://%3ca%20href=%22http/www.tin-nsdl.com/default.asp%22%3E%3Cfont%20face=%22Times%20New%20Roman%22%20size=%223%22%3Ehttp:/www.tin-nsdl.com/default.asp\"></a></p>','Getting a PAN card',0,'','publish','open','closed','','getting-a-pan-card','','','2009-01-12 06:17:04','2009-01-12 13:17:04','',0,'http://www.rightprocedure.com/?p=102',0,'post','',0),(101,1,'2008-12-13 05:14:49','2008-12-13 12:14:49','<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"highslide-image\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this, {captionId:\'caption_1228340546883\'});\" href=\"http://www.rightprocedure.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/rightWay.gif\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"height: 150px;\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"http://www.rightprocedure.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/rightWay.gif\" alt=\"image\" /></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Mavens are \"information specialists\", or \"people we rely upon to connect us with new information.\"They accumulate knowledge, especially about the marketplace, and know how to share it with others.\r\n</em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- </em><strong>Tipping Point</strong></p>\r\n\r\nYes, Maven is best term is what rightprocedure wants to be, instead of Marketplace, for us it\'s LifePlace,\r\n\r\nAt Right Procedure, We are going to try our best to collect the information from various sources and put out it on web, which will avail primary source of information about tasks, give initial cues and if possible, key contact details, to start working.

I asked my colleagues, some said it was easy, some said I have to be careful with agents and some said it isn’t worth all the effort that we put in.\n\nI got all sorts of information but didn’t get the right procedure or say the real picture. Now here started the journey to the unexplored. I called up my Insurance agent at the around 11 pm one night and asked him that it was a Corporate medical insurance, so what would be the ideal way to go about it.\n\nOkay I say \"go about it\" and not \"claiming it\" because you do not necessarily claim the money when you have a medical or health insurance.\n\nThere are two ways to \"go about it\"; I was enlightened, which are as follows:\n\nCashless- You can avail this method only if you are getting the patient admitted to one of hospitals that have a tie up with your Insurance Company.\n\nThis is the roughly the procedure.\n\nOur doctor suggested surgery. He said he would want to operate my mother on the following Monday. He said that the whole expense would be approximately Rs. 50,000. I had roughly one and a half day at hand. I was not tensed, I will tell you the reason after I tell you about the pre-surgery insurance formalities.\n\nDoctor has to sign the cashless claim form and write about the illness, the line of treatment and the purpose of surgery.\nIn this whole procedure the Cashless card is a must. Do not buy the story of your Insurance Agent telling to mention your employee id. It doesn’t work always.\n\nThe form has to be submitted to the Insurance department of the Hospital which they fax to the insurance company only and only if the hospital has a tie up.\nIt is advisable that you constantly keep in touch with your agent and take the 24 hour toll free number of the Insurance Company so that you can call and find out if they have received the fax from the hospital. Most of the times the hospital insurance wing doesn’t send it so make sure!\n\nThe Insurance Company only sends a fraction of the amount that the hospital claims. The rest of it comes after the discharge report is sent to them.\nNow let me narrate my story.\n\nI decided to get the cashless form signed by the doctor and submit it to the Insurance wing of the hospital. However when I went to submit the form I realized the person in charge of it was not there for the day, yet I was given the assurance that things would be looked after.\n\nEven after the assurance, I got the toll free number and the person on charge of the Hospital insurance wing. I kept on calling both the places and understood that either one of them was not being sincere. The hospital kept on telling me that they have faxed the form and Insurance Company kept on telling me that they haven’t.\n\nThe next day was Sunday. All the administrative offices in the hospital remained closed that day. My mother was to be operated early morning; I paid Rs. 10,000 as security so that the doctors could at least start.\n\nMoral: Get the cashless approval well in time to avoid paying the security deposit which you will face trouble to get back from the hospital authorities.\n\nIt was a conservative surgery and we could take mom back home the same day. Now we faced the real trial.\n\nThe hospital bill was in total Rs.66, 627. It wasn’t that big a deal. I called up my Insurance agent for the nth time that day and he told me that if I don’t get the formalities done within 5 pm in the evening, we would have tough time.\n\nThe hospital would not keep the patient because it would have prepared the final bill, neither would they let release her since they would not get the Insurance Claim approval from the Insurance Company after the regular working hours.\n\nSo here started the running around from the doctor’s cabin to the Insurance wing to my mother’s ward. The doctor had too many patients to take care of (understandable), yet he came for his regular ward visits and Okayed mom for discharge.\n\nThe discharge approval was sent to the Insurance wing and then after approximately 50 odd calls to the Insurance Company Call Center and bickering with the Insurance wing of the hospital, we finally received the fax approving the Rs.66,000.\n\nHealth Insurance or medical Insurance only covers expenses related to the health. They do not pay any administrative charges, like the food in the hospital, at times gloves that the doctors wear when checking or operating the patient. So that can run up to a nominal amount. It ideally should be 30% of your overall expenses.\n\nReimbursement- Reimbursement works if the hospital where you want to get the treatment done is not one of the listed hospitals with the Insurance Company.\n\nIt basically involves you paying the money upfront and then claiming it from the Insurance Company (getting the reimbursement).\n\nI got involved in the process of reimbursement when I tried to claim the post hospitalization expenses and the Chemotherapy sessions.\n\nLet me tell you the way which you can ideally follow when claiming for a reimbursement:\n<ul>\n	<li>Keep all your documents carefully. The bills, prescriptions, reports and discharge certificates are essential for you to claim any hospitalization.</li>\n	<li>Insurance Company requires the originals. So definitely keep a photocopy of the originals of your documents for your reference. However if you ask they are bound to give you back the reports, after you the claim procedure over.</li>\n	<li>In case of a deficiency of any document that is important for your claim, the Insurance Company compulsorily has to inform you about the requisite.</li>\n	<li>The money should reach you within 21 days (this can vary with the Insurance Company).</li>\n</ul>\nIt is important to understand that it is integral to send reports of the tests for which you send a bill. The report is as important as the bill to establish the credibility of the claim.\n\nDo not expect for the entire to be reimbursed that you have claimed because administrative charges are deducted.\n\nIn my case the agent didn’t inform me about the deficiency neither did the claim come within 21 days. I got it after 44 long days. This situation arose in spite of me calling the agent incessantly; in fact it was as regular as every morning.\n\nAnother important thing that goes unnoticed most of the times is that the hospital charges almost become double when you avail cashless. I got to know it when my mom was going through her chemotherapy sessions. We availed for cashless for her first session and the bill was Rs.39,000. On the other hand when we started paying cash, it came down to Rs. 22,000.\n\nSo I wish you all the luck!','How to claim Medical/Health Insurance',0,'','inherit','open','open','','73-autosave','','','2009-01-15 04:12:41','2009-01-15 11:12:41','',73,'http://www.rightprocedure.com/?p=80',0,'revision','',0),(184,2,'2008-12-15 08:02:08','2008-12-15 15:02:08','This is the initial list of topics, We want to publish on this website. if you would know anything specific about following topics or you know about any new topics which you would like to hear from us.

CARA has accredited several agencies in India to  manage the process for you. The agency you choose is important. Since there are so many choosing an agency is sometimes a difficult process.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There is no \"right\" agency as such. There are several good ones in Pune for example and people find one better than another based on their background (economic/social), initial interactions with the agency personnel, hearsay from other parents who adopted, current waiting time etc.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I would suggest choosing a place geographically close to you, ideally in the same city. There are a few physical interactions needed during the application process.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Moreover, after identifying the baby there is a short (few days to a couple of weeks) period where you have the baby as a foster parent, where you are not allowed to take it outside the city. It is a good idea to visit at least three agencies before choosing one. You are making a very important decision and taking your time meeting different social workers and seeing the orphanages will let you understand the process better and lets you find an agency closest to your personality!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Filing the application</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Once you select an agency you need to file your adoption application. There is a lot of paperwork to be done. But it sounds more complex than it is. Each agency has its own list of documents, but in general you will need identity and financial proofs, references from friends, undertaking from a close relative (to take care of the child in case both parents die early). Also there will be forms that each agency has that each parent fills in. This lets the agency understand your background and upbringing and also makes you think about the choices you have for your adopted baby.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A sample list is provided towards the end of this post.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Wait</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After filing the paperwork with the agency, you get on to their queue. The waiting period depends on various factors: the agency you chose, whether you are applying for a boy, girl or either. Waits tend to be from two months to well over a year. This is one factor for many in a choice of an agency: if you are in a hurry you would go for an agency with a shorter waitlist. If you don\'t mind the wait or would prefer it to keep a gap between an existing child a longer wait is fine.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You don\'t have much to do during the wait. The agency completes some formalities like a home visit. It also holds interviews and counseling to talk to you about your backgrounds, preparedness as parents and awareness of issues dealing with adoption. You should be frank in these meetings and also ask any questions you may have. Some agencies also have mandatory workshops with prospective parents where senior staff and specialists participate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Adoption</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When a matching baby is available and it is your turn in the list you get called to see the baby. You get to see the child\'s medical records and possibly some background information. Please do take the child to a pediatrician and get all the tests they suggest, so you are also comfortable with the health of the baby.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Once you choose the baby it takes a few days for the foster-care agreements to be ready. Then you can take the baby home. Until the court okays the adoption you are foster-parents for the baby. At this time, you also apply through the agency lawyers to the court for becoming legal parents.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The court then sets a date for a “hearing” where you have to meet the judge along with the baby and the social worker and lawyer. The time of the actual hearing date after applying to the court depends on the judge, his load and some luck! It could be anywhere from four to eight months.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During this period you have to submit monthly reports of the baby to the agency and possibly physically visit the agency periodically.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the hearing the judge will ask you to make some investments on the child’s behalf based on your family income. Usually it includes an insurance policy and/or some recurring savings deposit policy in the name of the child.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You then draw up an agreement on stamp paper with the agency which is the formal request to the judge for adoption. This needs to be registered at a Registrar’s office (same place where you register rent agreements and land sale!) where they take your photographs and thumbprints.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The judge also passes an order (“Court Order”) to the effect that you are now officially the parents. When you have the investments done you should give a copy to the lawyer and he submits it as proof to the court.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You also get a “photo-id” for the child. This is a letter written by the agency with a photograph of the child stating that the child belongs to you.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Congratulations, the process is now done!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Costs</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As per law the costs that you required to pay agency include only the cost of bringing up the baby at the agency (food and medical costs) and the lawyers and court fees applicable. The agency is not allowed to solicit money against adoptions other than this amount.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I would recommend that once your process if fully done, depending on your means, you do make a donation. Most agencies have children in their orphanages that do not get adopted because of some medical condition and your money would go a long way in supporting them or allowing them to keep additional children.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Post-adoption process:</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After adoption you need to file quarterly reports for the first two years and then six-monthly for a few more years after that. Make sure that your investments continue as per the court order.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In many places (like schools, colleges) you need the birth certificate of a child as proof. However no birth certificate is issued as part of the regular adoption process. You are supposed to use the photo-id and the court order instead. This is a pain in many places firstly because not every institution knows about it and secondly the child starts feeling different.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Some municipal bodies have started issuing their standard birth certificates to adopted children as well. Talk to your agency as well as the local municipal commissioner and try hard to get one. We are just in the process of starting the process with the Pune Municipal Corporation and will update this post if and when we are succesful!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Notes</h4>\r\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">This      document is mainly for Indian parents adopting in India. For      foreigners your agency would be in your country though they would tie up      with an Indian agency.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">This      is India:      unfortunately there are two laws under which you can adopt based on your      birth religion. Hindus adopt under the HAMA (Hindu Adoption and Maintenance      Act) where you become the \"legal parents\" of the child. Other      religions come under the GAWA (Guardianship And Welfare Act) where you are      \"legal guardians\" of the child. For all practical purposes these      don\'t make a difference. Inheritance of family property and assets are the      only place it is affected, but regardless of which act you adopt under you      should write up your wills so there is no ambiguity (especially if you      also have biological children).Hopefully this discrimination will be removed soon.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">It is      also possible for single mothers and single fathers to adopt.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">If it      is a first child you can choose to adopt either a boy, girl or say you      don\'t mind either. However if it is a second child, usually you can only      adopt one of the other sex. (Well technically you can adopt another of the      same sex, but then the second baby will always be under GAWA regardless of      your religion).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Sample List of documents:</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">All copies need to be attested by a notary.

I think doing it yourself should be much better as it does gives you experience of working with government offices. also after doing all hard work while getting NOC from hyd, I thought this should be miniscule task. so Wanted to do it myself.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After enquiring further, I came to know that person called Mr. Pazze handles all matters about vehicle outside Maharashtra, So I went to him and He handed me a document listing all the following. He is key person in carrying out this whole work. He will describe you whole procedure with very cool head and seems to be quite nice guy.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>NOC from original state where vehicle belongs(in my case Hyd, AP). 2 copies original</li>\r\n	<li>RC book original, registration card</li>\r\n	<li>Vehicle Insurance</li>\r\n	<li>Invoice receipt - vehicle purchase dealer receipt</li>\r\n	<li>Entry tax , in case when you bring the vehicle before 30 months of registration date.</li>\r\n	<li>Address proof where you are staying currently with photo</li>\r\n	<li>Affidavit of non-stolen vehicle by registered owner</li>\r\n	<li>Form. No 26,27, 20,33 . you will get these forms free at rto.</li>\r\n	<li>Pencil chassis print - 5 original</li>\r\n	<li>NOC from Police Commisioner pune.</li>\r\n	<li>Registration fee- 320</li>\r\n	<li>7 % for invoice cost as registration</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nYou can refund previous paid tax by applying at Hydrabad.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He asked me to get the affidavit on 20 Rs stamp paper. so I went outside, was inquiring abt affidavit, one person demanded me Rs 200 per affidavit and I asked some other person he was taking 100 Rs so I asked him to do the work. so while having conversation with him, I came to know that He also had reregistered his vehicle but through agents and in turn paid quite big amount to get the work done, he was happy knowing that I am doing work myself not through RTO agent.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In pt. 10. to get NOC from Police Commisioner pune., you need a letter from RTO. You will get this letter from Mr. Pazze, after showing him all the above docs, after verifying docs, he will give you a letter from RTO to Commissioner of police, You need to give it in Commissioner of police office with xerox of NOC from hyd, and residential proof. and after 7 working days you will get the NOC from Pune police. The concerned person is Mr. Chavan. He will issue you NOC in 10 minutes, if everything is ok.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then you need to submit all of above docs to Mr. Pazze and he will check the things and you need to get assessement done from counter 30/31( i think). then after getting how much amount you need to pay, you need to pay tax at counter 23/24 (i think..). and then re submit docs along with receipt of tax payment to Mr. Pazze. He will ask you to see him after 1 and half months.</p>\r\n\r\nSo till now, it took around 2 weeks to get this much work done.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So finally I got my docs back from RTO officer, after that I had to go to alandi office to acquire a sign from RTO officer who checks the vehicles and gives you back the paper which takes 1 hours.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now I need to give this docs back to RTO and get New maharashtra registration number and then apply for tax refund from hyderabad office.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"mailto:admin@rightprocedure.com\">Email us</a> if you any further queries.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I have written this blog in 2007. RTO procedure might have underwent some changes. if any of you go to RTO and find something is changed, I do request you to add comment or post link to your blog to help people who read this blog.</p>','Transfer Of Vehicle To Pune From Other State ',0,'Transfer of vehicle to pune from other state and re-registration of vehicle in pune ','inherit','open','open','','22-revision-10','','','2008-12-03 13:22:32','2008-12-03 20:22:32','',22,'http://www.rightprocedure.com/?p=116',0,'revision','',0),(117,3,'2008-12-04 04:22:18','2008-12-04 11:22:18','<strong><span style=\"color: #003300;\">How to obtain vehicle NOC </span></strong>\r\n<blockquote><strong><span style=\"color: #003300;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: normal; \">A guide to get No Objection Certificate.</span></span></strong></blockquote>\r\n<span style=\"color: #003300;\"><strong>How to re-register vehicle</strong></span>\r\n<blockquote>Describes the right procedure to get your vehicle re-registered with different state.</blockquote>\r\n<strong><span style=\"color: #003300;\">Getting NOC for car to drive for limited period in Mumbai</span></strong>\r\n<blockquote>A guide to get NOC for limited period in Mumbai.</blockquote>\r\n<span style=\"color: #003300;\"><strong> Claiming health insurance</strong></span>\r\n<blockquote>How to claim your health insurance right way?</blockquote>\r\n<span style=\"color: #003300;\"><strong>Adopting a child</strong></span>\r\n<blockquote>Are you thinking of adopting a child?

I was well settled in Hyderabad so I bought a bike there.\r\nUnder some uncertain situation I permanently transferred to Mumbai office,  so I took my bike with me\r\nto Mumbai and in few months I moved to Pune since I changed my job. As these were pretty quick moves, I didn\'t get a chance to get NOC for the bike before moving out of Hyderabad.\r\nBefore moving out, though in vain, I tried to get information about getting an NOC but didn\'t get useful information on the internet. The other sources misled me into believing that NOC is not required, so I was clueless and was happily riding my bike on the streets of Pune.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nUntil one fine day, a Traffic policeman stopped me and asked for NOC. I didnt have it and he asked me to pay road tax which was Rs.4000. Obviously I couldn\'t pay that much for a small mistake (\"seemingly small\") or thing which I didn\'t know. However I settled the issue by paying him whatever money I had in my wallet (I guess, some 300 rupees). Since then I started the quest of knowing the process of getting NOC so that I can peacefully ride my bike in city.\r\n\r\nI was only left with 2 options either to sell this bike in Hyd or to obtain NOC. I didnt want to sell the bike as I loved it.\r\nMy friend in Hyderabad asked one RTO agent to do this task for me but he failed to do so. There was no option but to try it myself. I went to Hyderabad with my bike and underwent the process to obtain the NOC. After lots of rounds to various police stations and RTO offices due to wrong information, I finally got the NOC.\r\n\r\nSo here is my attempt to  throw some light on the procedure to get NOC.\r\nThe procedure is as follows:\r\n\r\n1) Get a clearance certificate from traffic police - 1 day(2-3 hrs)\r\n-- need to go to police control room, near Nampalli, Hyderabad\r\n-- police were very helpful and nice there.\r\n-- no money\r\n2) Getting the challan from E-seva office\r\n-- need a xerox of RC book\r\n-- you should know that under which police station area, your address on RC card comes since you need to mention those details on the form to be submitted to E-seva office.\r\n-- knowing Telugu will help (knowing the local language always helps)\r\n-- Rs. 100 for Hyderabad and Rs 200 for Cyberabad\r\n\r\n3) E-seva people will courier this request to police station next day\r\n-- to speed-up the process, you can get the form signed from Eseva officer and take it to police station yourself. (I did this)\r\n\r\n4) Police station people will call you once they get forms from Eseva people\r\nthey will call you for verification,\r\n-- to speed-up the process, you can also go to that Police station and ask for your form, if you want to speed up process.\r\n-- dont expect much assistance here\r\n-- they might ask you for money\r\n-- knowing Telugu will help\r\n\r\n5) In some cases,they will forward this request to ACP office for that police station\r\n6) ACP office will forward this request to Police headquarters.\r\n7) Finally you need to get the no objection certificate from Crime branch, Police\r\n8) Then you need to go to RTO for getting NOC from RTA.\r\nDocuments needed\r\n- RC book\r\n- Insurance\r\n- PUC\r\n- Police Clearance\r\n- Traffic police clearance\r\n- here it takes 2 days, if requested they will do it in a single working day.\r\n\r\nIt took me 5 working days inspite of doing everthing myself (I didn\'t wait for E-seva to courier it, I myself took the signed form to the police station) , without this urgency it should take at max 2 weeks, as police verification requires atleast 1 week.\r\n\r\nI would like to dedicate this post to some people I met during this visit, and without whose help this work would not have possible at all. I dont know their names.\r\nBut I think I wont forget them.\r\nI will call them \"few good men (and women)\", people I am mentioning are the ladies at Eseva office at Kukatpalli, then officer at Cyberabad police HQ and officer at Attapur RTA. Seeing these people do good work, my belief in good people philosophy further strengthened.  And it also redoubled my own enthusiasm to work with dedication, honesty and hardwork.\r\n\r\nSo hats of \"few good men (and women)\" :)','No objection certificate for vehicle transfer',0,'No objection certificate for vehicle transfer in hyderabad, Andhra pradesh ','inherit','open','open','','19-revision-7','','','2008-12-05 04:04:34','2008-12-05 11:04:34','',19,'http://www.rightprocedure.com/?p=137',0,'revision','',0),(138,1,'2008-12-15 07:02:43','2008-12-15 14:02:43','<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">S</span></strong>o after getting NOC from Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, Next step was to re-register bike in Pune, I needed to deal with RTO, Pune, Maharashtra, Compare to hyd RTO, I found pune RTO to be much clumsier, full of agents, no PRO to get information with. still able to get information about what to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When I went to RTO, I was surrounded by Agents, who were demandeing 2000 Rs apart from all other taxes. I think doing it yourself should be much better as it does gives you experience of working with government offices. also after doing all hard work while getting NOC from hyd, I thought this should be miniscule task. so Wanted to do it myself.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After enquiring further, I came to know that person called Mr. Pazze handles all matters about vehicle outside Maharashtra, So I went to him and He handed me a document listing all the following. He is key person in carrying out this whole work. He will describe you whole procedure with very cool head and seems to be quite nice guy.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>NOC from original state where vehicle belongs(in my case Hyd, AP). 2 copies original</li>\r\n	<li>RC book original, registration card</li>\r\n	<li>Vehicle Insurance</li>\r\n	<li>Invoice receipt - vehicle purchase dealer receipt</li>\r\n	<li>Entry tax , in case when you bring the vehicle before 30 months of registration date.</li>\r\n	<li>Address proof where you are staying currently with photo</li>\r\n	<li>Affidavit of non-stolen vehicle by registered owner</li>\r\n	<li>Form. No 26,27, 20,33 . you will get these forms free at rto.</li>\r\n	<li>Pencil chassis print - 5 original</li>\r\n	<li>NOC from Police Commisioner pune.</li>\r\n	<li>Registration fee- 320</li>\r\n	<li>7 % for invoice cost as registration</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nYou can refund previous paid tax by applying at Hydrabad.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He asked me to get the affidavit on 20 Rs stamp paper. so I went outside, was inquiring abt affidavit, one person demanded me Rs 200 per affidavit and I asked some other person he was taking 100 Rs so I asked him to do the work. so while having conversation with him, I came to know that He also had reregistered his vehicle but through agents and in turn paid quite big amount to get the work done, he was happy knowing that I am doing work myself not through RTO agent.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In pt. 10. to get NOC from Police Commisioner pune., you need a letter from RTO. You will get this letter from Mr. Pazze, after showing him all the above docs, after verifying docs, he will give you a letter from RTO to Commissioner of police, You need to give it in Commissioner of police office with xerox of NOC from hyd, and residential proof. and after 7 working days you will get the NOC from Pune police. The concerned person is Mr. Chavan. He will issue you NOC in 10 minutes, if everything is ok.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then you need to submit all of above docs to Mr. Pazze and he will check the things and you need to get assessement done from counter 30/31( i think). then after getting how much amount you need to pay, you need to pay tax at counter 23/24 (i think..). and then re submit docs along with receipt of tax payment to Mr. Pazze. He will ask you to see him after 1 and half months.</p>\r\n\r\nSo till now, it took around 2 weeks to get this much work done.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So finally I got my docs back from RTO officer, after that I had to go to alandi office to acquire a sign from RTO officer who checks the vehicles and gives you back the paper which takes 1 hours.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now I need to give this docs back to RTO and get New maharashtra registration number and then apply for tax refund from hyderabad office.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I have written this blog in 2007. RTO procedure might have underwent some changes. if any of you go to RTO and find something is changed, I do request you to add comment or post link to your blog to help people who read this blog.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">please post comments, if you have any queries. also if you know anything more than whats written here, please let us know. we would like to hear from you.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>','Transfer of vehicle to Pune from other state ',0,'Transfer of vehicle to pune from other state and re-registration of vehicle in pune ','inherit','open','open','','22-revision-11','','','2008-12-15 07:02:43','2008-12-15 14:02:43','',22,'http://www.rightprocedure.com/?p=138',0,'revision','',0),(139,3,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=113407146558880801700.00045eeb9c2585f536697&amp;z=6\"></a>\nI went from delhi to bagdogra by deccan airlines.  The cost of two return tickets was for around Rs.14000.\nI tavelled by a Maruti van from Bagdogra to Gangtok.

Over the years I had seen many of my friends adopt and so I had some understanding of the process.</p>\r\n\r\nOnce we had decided we spent some time talking with our friends and getting names and details of agencies in Pune (where we currently live). We visited three of them, each of them had been strongly referred to by people who had actually adopted from them.  Finally we decided on BSSK based on our \"comfort-level\" with the place.\r\n\r\nOnce we had decided we spent a hectic week getting all the papers together. Eight months after we applied Aditi came home. She was three months then. We had primed Akash a few months after we applied and by then he was very eager to have his little sister come home.\r\n\r\nShe is now two and a half and it has been a wonderful time. The rest of this article describes the process for adoption based on our recent experience and the experience of some of our friends.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<h4>In A Nutshell</h4>\r\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Choose the adoption agency</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">File the application</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Wait for your turn</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Get the child home</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Complete      the legal formalities</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Follow post-adoption procedures</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Choosing the agency:</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">All adoption in India goes through a central agency CARA. CARA has accredited several agencies in India to  manage the process for you. The agency you choose is important. Since there are so many agencies, choosing one is sometimes a difficult process.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There is no \"right\" agency as such. There are several good ones in Pune, for example, and people find one better than another based on their background (economic/social), initial interactions with the agency personnel, hearsay from other parents who adopted, current waiting time etc.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I would suggest choosing a place geographically close to you, ideally in the same city. There are a few physical interactions needed during the application process. Moreover, after identifying the baby there is a short period (few days to a couple of weeks) where you have the baby as a foster parent, where you are not allowed to take it outside the city.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It is a good idea to visit at least three agencies before choosing one. You are making a very important decision and taking your time meeting different social workers and seeing the orphanages will let you understand the process better and lets you find an agency closest to your personality!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Filing the application</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Once you select an agency you need to file your adoption application. There is a lot of paperwork to be done. But it sounds more complex than it is. Each agency has its own list of documents, but in general you will need identity and financial proofs, references from friends, undertaking from a close relative (to take care of the child in case both parents die early). Also there will be forms that each agency has that each parent fills in. This lets the agency understand your background and upbringing and also makes you think about the choices you have for your adopted baby.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A sample list is provided towards the end of this post.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Wait</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After filing the paperwork with the agency, you get on to their queue. The waiting period depends on various factors: the agency you chose and whether you are applying for a boy, girl or either. Waits tend to be from two months to well over a year. This is one factor for many in a choice of an agency: if you are in a hurry you would go for an agency with a shorter waitlist. If you don\'t mind the wait or would prefer it to keep a gap between an existing child a longer wait is fine.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You don\'t have much to do during the wait. The agency completes some formalities like a home visit. It also holds interviews and counseling to talk to you about your backgrounds, preparedness as parents and awareness of issues dealing with adoption. You should be frank in these meetings and also ask any questions you may have. Some agencies also have mandatory workshops with prospective parents where senior staff and specialists participate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Adoption</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When a baby that meets your criteria is available and it is your turn in the list you get called to see the baby. You get to see the child\'s medical records and possibly some background information. Please do take the child to a pediatrician and get all the tests they suggest, so you are also comfortable with the health of the baby.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Once you accept the baby it takes a few days for the foster-care agreements to be ready. Then you can take the baby home. Until the court okays the adoption you are foster-parents for the baby. At this time, you also apply through the agency lawyers to the court for becoming legal parents.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The court then sets a date for a “hearing” where you have to meet the judge along with the baby and the social worker and lawyer. The time of the actual hearing date after applying to the court depends on the judge, his load and some luck! It could be anywhere from four to eight months.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During this period you have to submit monthly reports of the baby to the agency and possibly physically visit the agency periodically.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the hearing the judge will ask you to make some investments on the child’s behalf based on your family income. Usually it includes an insurance policy and/or some recurring savings deposit policy in the name of the child.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You then draw up an agreement on stamp paper with the agency which is the formal request to the judge for adoption. This needs to be registered at a Registrar’s office (same place where you register rent agreements and land sale!) where they take your photographs and thumbprints.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The judge also passes an order (“Court Order”) to the effect that you are now officially the parents. When you have the investments done you should give a copy to the lawyer and he submits it as proof to the court.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You also get a “photo-id” for the child. This is a letter written by the agency with a photograph of the child stating that the child belongs to you.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Congratulations, the process is now done!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Costs</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As per law the costs that you required to pay agency include only the cost of bringing up the baby at the agency (food and medical costs) and the lawyers and court fees applicable. The agency is not allowed to solicit any extra money.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I would recommend that once your process is complete, depending on your means, you do make a donation. Most agencies have children in their orphanages that do not get adopted because of some medical condition and your money would go a long way in supporting them or allowing them to keep additional children.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Post-adoption process:</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After adoption you need to file quarterly reports for the first two years and then six-monthly for a few more years after that. Make sure that your investments continue as per the court order.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In many places (like schools, colleges) you need the birth certificate of a child as proof. However no birth certificate is issued as part of the regular adoption process. You are supposed to use the photo-id and the court order instead. This is a pain in many places firstly because not every institution knows about it and secondly the child starts feeling different.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Some municipal bodies have started issuing their standard birth certificates to adopted children as well. Talk to your agency as well as the local municipal commissioner and try hard to get one. We are just in the process of starting the process with the Pune Municipal Corporation and will update this post if and when we are succesful!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Notes</h4>\r\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">This      document is mainly for Indian parents adopting in India. For      foreigners your agency would be in your country and they would tie up      with an Indian agency.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">This      is India:      unfortunately there are two laws under which you can adopt based on your      birth religion. Hindus adopt under the HAMA (Hindu Adoption and Maintenance      Act) where you become the \"legal parents\" of the child. Other      religions come under the GAWA (Guardianship And Welfare Act) where you are      \"legal guardians\" of the child. For all practical purposes these      don\'t make a difference. Inheritance of family property and assets are the      only place it is affected, but regardless of which act you adopt under you      should write up your wills so there is no ambiguity (especially if you      also have biological children).Hopefully this discrimination will be removed soon.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">It is      also possible for single mothers and single fathers to adopt (single men can only adopt sons).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">If it      is a first child you can choose to adopt either a boy, girl or say you      don\'t mind either. However if it is a second child, usually you can only      adopt one of the other sex. (Well technically you can adopt another of the      same sex, but then the second baby will always be under GAWA regardless of      your religion).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Sample List of documents:</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">All copies need to be attested by a notary. Notaries are available at civil or criminal courts and usually charge between Rs 5 to Rs 10 per signature.

It could be anywhere from four to eight months.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During this period you have to submit monthly reports of the baby to the agency and possibly physically visit the agency periodically.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the hearing the judge will ask you to make some investments on the child’s behalf based on your family income. Usually it includes an insurance policy and/or some recurring savings deposit policy in the name of the child.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You then draw up an agreement on stamp paper with the agency which is the formal request to the judge for adoption. This needs to be registered at a Registrar’s office (same place where you register rent agreements and land sale!) where they take your photographs and thumbprints.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The judge also passes an order (“Court Order”) to the effect that you are now officially the parents. When you have the investments done you should give a copy to the lawyer and he submits it as proof to the court.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You also get a “photo-id” for the child. This is a letter written by the agency with a photograph of the child stating that the child belongs to you.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Congratulations, the process is now done!</p>\n\n<h4>Costs</h4>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As per law the costs that you required to pay agency include only the cost of bringing up the baby at the agency (food and medical costs) and the lawyers and court fees applicable. The agency is not allowed to solicit any extra money.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I would recommend that once your process is complete, depending on your means, you do make a donation. Most agencies have children in their orphanages that do not get adopted because of some medical condition and your money would go a long way in supporting them or allowing them to keep additional children.</p>\n\n<h4>Post-adoption process:</h4>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After adoption you need to file quarterly reports for the first two years and then six-monthly for a few more years after that. Make sure that your investments continue as per the court order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In many places (like schools, colleges) you need the birth certificate of a child as proof. However no birth certificate is issued as part of the regular adoption process. You are supposed to use the photo-id and the court order instead. This is a pain in many places firstly because not every institution knows about it and secondly the child starts feeling different.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Some municipal bodies have started issuing their standard birth certificates to adopted children as well. Talk to your agency as well as the local municipal commissioner and try hard to get one. We are just in the process of starting the process with the Pune Municipal Corporation and will update this post if and when we are succesful!</p>\n\n<h4>Notes</h4>\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">This      document is mainly for Indian parents adopting in India.

Other      religions come under the GAWA (Guardianship And Welfare Act) where you are      \"legal guardians\" of the child. For all practical purposes these      don\'t make a difference. Inheritance of family property and assets are the      only place it is affected, but regardless of which act you adopt under you      should write up your wills so there is no ambiguity (especially if you      also have biological children).Hopefully this discrimination will be removed soon.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">It is      also possible for single mothers and single fathers to adopt (single men can only adopt sons).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">If it      is a first child you can choose to adopt either a boy, girl or say you      don\'t mind either.

CARA has accredited several agencies in India to  manage the process for you. The agency you choose is important. Since there are so many choosing an agency is sometimes a difficult process.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There is no \"right\" agency as such. There are several good ones in Pune for example and people find one better than another based on their background (economic/social), initial interactions with the agency personnel, hearsay from other parents who adopted, current waiting time etc.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I would suggest choosing a place geographically close to you, ideally in the same city. There are a few physical interactions needed during the application process.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Moreover, after identifying the baby there is a short (few days to a couple of weeks) period where you have the baby as a foster parent, where you are not allowed to take it outside the city. It is a good idea to visit at least three agencies before choosing one. You are making a very important decision and taking your time meeting different social workers and seeing the orphanages will let you understand the process better and lets you find an agency closest to your personality!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Filing the application</h2>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Once you select an agency you need to file your adoption application. There is a lot of paperwork to be done. But it sounds more complex than it is. Each agency has its own list of documents, but in general you will need identity and financial proofs, references from friends, undertaking from a close relative (to take care of the child in case both parents die early). Also there will be forms that each agency has that each parent fills in. This lets the agency understand your background and upbringing and also makes you think about the choices you have for your adopted baby.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A sample list is provided towards the end of this post.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Wait</h2>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After filing the paperwork with the agency, you get on to their queue. The waiting period depends on various factors: the agency you chose, whether you are applying for a boy, girl or either. Waits tend to be from two months to well over a year. This is one factor for many in a choice of an agency: if you are in a hurry you would go for an agency with a shorter waitlist. If you don\'t mind the wait or would prefer it to keep a gap between an existing child a longer wait is fine.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You don\'t have much to do during the wait. The agency completes some formalities like a home visit. It also holds interviews and counseling to talk to you about your backgrounds, preparedness as parents and awareness of issues dealing with adoption. You should be frank in these meetings and also ask any questions you may have. Some agencies also have mandatory workshops with prospective parents where senior staff and specialists participate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Adoption</h2>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When a matching baby is available and it is your turn in the list you get called to see the baby. You get to see the child\'s medical records and possibly some background information. Please do take the child to a pediatrician and get all the tests they suggest, so you are also comfortable with the health of the baby.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Once you choose the baby it takes a few days for the foster-care agreements to be ready. Then you can take the baby home. Until the court okays the adoption you are foster-parents for the baby. At this time, you also apply through the agency lawyers to the court for becoming legal parents.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The court then sets a date for a “hearing” where you have to meet the judge along with the baby and the social worker and lawyer.

There are several good ones in Pune for example and people find one better than another based on their background (economic/social), initial interactions with the agency personnel, hearsay from other parents who adopted, current waiting time etc.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I would suggest choosing a place geographically close to you, ideally in the same city. There are a few physical interactions needed during the application process.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Moreover, after identifying the baby there is a short (few days to a couple of weeks) period where you have the baby as a foster parent, where you are not allowed to take it outside the city. It is a good idea to visit at least three agencies before choosing one. You are making a very important decision and taking your time meeting different social workers and seeing the orphanages will let you understand the process better and lets you find an agency closest to your personality!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Filing the application</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Once you select an agency you need to file your adoption application. There is a lot of paperwork to be done. But it sounds more complex than it is. Each agency has its own list of documents, but in general you will need identity and financial proofs, references from friends, undertaking from a close relative (to take care of the child in case both parents die early). Also there will be forms that each agency has that each parent fills in. This lets the agency understand your background and upbringing and also makes you think about the choices you have for your adopted baby.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A sample list is provided towards the end of this post.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Wait</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After filing the paperwork with the agency, you get on to their queue. The waiting period depends on various factors: the agency you chose, whether you are applying for a boy, girl or either. Waits tend to be from two months to well over a year. This is one factor for many in a choice of an agency: if you are in a hurry you would go for an agency with a shorter waitlist. If you don\'t mind the wait or would prefer it to keep a gap between an existing child a longer wait is fine.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You don\'t have much to do during the wait. The agency completes some formalities like a home visit. It also holds interviews and counseling to talk to you about your backgrounds, preparedness as parents and awareness of issues dealing with adoption. You should be frank in these meetings and also ask any questions you may have. Some agencies also have mandatory workshops with prospective parents where senior staff and specialists participate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Adoption</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When a matching baby is available and it is your turn in the list you get called to see the baby. You get to see the child\'s medical records and possibly some background information. Please do take the child to a pediatrician and get all the tests they suggest, so you are also comfortable with the health of the baby.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Once you choose the baby it takes a few days for the foster-care agreements to be ready. Then you can take the baby home. Until the court okays the adoption you are foster-parents for the baby. At this time, you also apply through the agency lawyers to the court for becoming legal parents.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The court then sets a date for a “hearing” where you have to meet the judge along with the baby and the social worker and lawyer. The time of the actual hearing date after applying to the court depends on the judge, his load and some luck! It could be anywhere from four to eight months.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During this period you have to submit monthly reports of the baby to the agency and possibly physically visit the agency periodically.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the hearing the judge will ask you to make some investments on the child’s behalf based on your family income. Usually it includes an insurance policy and/or some recurring savings deposit policy in the name of the child.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You then draw up an agreement on stamp paper with the agency which is the formal request to the judge for adoption. This needs to be registered at a Registrar’s office (same place where you register rent agreements and land sale!) where they take your photographs and thumbprints.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The judge also passes an order (“Court Order”) to the effect that you are now officially the parents. When you have the investments done you should give a copy to the lawyer and he submits it as proof to the court.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You also get a “photo-id” for the child. This is a letter written by the agency with a photograph of the child stating that the child belongs to you.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Congratulations, the process is now done!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Costs</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As per law the costs that you required to pay agency include only the cost of bringing up the baby at the agency (food and medical costs) and the lawyers and court fees applicable. The agency is not allowed to solicit money against adoptions other than this amount.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I would recommend that once your process if fully done, depending on your means, you do make a donation. Most agencies have children in their orphanages that do not get adopted because of some medical condition and your money would go a long way in supporting them or allowing them to keep additional children.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Post-adoption process:</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After adoption you need to file quarterly reports for the first two years and then six-monthly for a few more years after that. Make sure that your investments continue as per the court order.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In many places (like schools, colleges) you need the birth certificate of a child as proof. However no birth certificate is issued as part of the regular adoption process. You are supposed to use the photo-id and the court order instead. This is a pain in many places firstly because not every institution knows about it and secondly the child starts feeling different.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Some municipal bodies have started issuing their standard birth certificates to adopted children as well. Talk to your agency as well as the local municipal commissioner and try hard to get one. We are just in the process of starting the process with the Pune Municipal Corporation and will update this post if and when we are succesful!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Notes</h4>\r\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">This      document is mainly for Indian parents adopting in India.

Over the years I had seen many of my friends adopt and so I had some understanding of the process.</p>\r\n\r\nOnce we had decided we spent some time talking with our friends and getting names and details of agencies in Pune (where we currently live). We visited three of them, each of them had been strongly referred to by people who had actually adopted from them.  Finally we decided on BSSK based on our \"comfort-level\" with the place.\r\n\r\nOnce we had decided we spent a hectic week getting all the papers together. Eight months after we applied Aditi came home. She was three months then. We had primed Akash a few months after we applied and by then he was very eager to have his little sister come home.\r\n\r\nShe is now two and a half and it has been a wonderful time. The rest of this article describes the process for adoption based on our recent experience and the experience of some of our friends.\r\n<h4>In A Nutshell</h4>\r\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Choose the adoption agency</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">File the application</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Wait for your turn</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Get the child home</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Complete      the legal formalities</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Follow post-adoption procedures</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Choosing the agency:</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">All adoption in India goes through a central agency CARA. CARA has accredited several agencies in India to  manage the process for you. The agency you choose is important. Since there are so many agencies, choosing one is sometimes a difficult process.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There is no \"right\" agency as such. There are several good ones in Pune, for example, and people find one better than another based on their background (economic/social), initial interactions with the agency personnel, hearsay from other parents who adopted, current waiting time etc.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I would suggest choosing a place geographically close to you, ideally in the same city. There are a few physical interactions needed during the application process. Moreover, after identifying the baby there is a short period (few days to a couple of weeks) where you have the baby as a foster parent, where you are not allowed to take it outside the city.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It is a good idea to visit at least three agencies before choosing one. You are making a very important decision and taking your time meeting different social workers and seeing the orphanages will let you understand the process better and lets you find an agency closest to your personality!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Filing the application</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Once you select an agency you need to file your adoption application. There is a lot of paperwork to be done. But it sounds more complex than it is. Each agency has its own list of documents, but in general you will need identity and financial proofs, references from friends, undertaking from a close relative (to take care of the child in case both parents die early). Also there will be forms that each agency has that each parent fills in. This lets the agency understand your background and upbringing and also makes you think about the choices you have for your adopted baby.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A sample list is provided towards the end of this post.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Wait</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After filing the paperwork with the agency, you get on to their queue. The waiting period depends on various factors: the agency you chose and whether you are applying for a boy, girl or either. Waits tend to be from two months to well over a year. This is one factor for many in a choice of an agency: if you are in a hurry you would go for an agency with a shorter waitlist. If you don\'t mind the wait or would prefer it to keep a gap between an existing child a longer wait is fine.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You don\'t have much to do during the wait. The agency completes some formalities like a home visit. It also holds interviews and counseling to talk to you about your backgrounds, preparedness as parents and awareness of issues dealing with adoption. You should be frank in these meetings and also ask any questions you may have. Some agencies also have mandatory workshops with prospective parents where senior staff and specialists participate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Adoption</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When a baby that meets your criteria is available and it is your turn in the list you get called to see the baby. You get to see the child\'s medical records and possibly some background information. Please do take the child to a pediatrician and get all the tests they suggest, so you are also comfortable with the health of the baby.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Once you accept the baby it takes a few days for the foster-care agreements to be ready. Then you can take the baby home. Until the court okays the adoption you are foster-parents for the baby. At this time, you also apply through the agency lawyers to the court for becoming legal parents.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The court then sets a date for a “hearing” where you have to meet the judge along with the baby and the social worker and lawyer. The time of the actual hearing date after applying to the court depends on the judge, his load and some luck! It could be anywhere from four to eight months.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During this period you have to submit monthly reports of the baby to the agency and possibly physically visit the agency periodically.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the hearing the judge will ask you to make some investments on the child’s behalf based on your family income. Usually it includes an insurance policy and/or some recurring savings deposit policy in the name of the child.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You then draw up an agreement on stamp paper with the agency which is the formal request to the judge for adoption. This needs to be registered at a Registrar’s office (same place where you register rent agreements and land sale!) where they take your photographs and thumbprints.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The judge also passes an order (“Court Order”) to the effect that you are now officially the parents. When you have the investments done you should give a copy to the lawyer and he submits it as proof to the court.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You also get a “photo-id” for the child. This is a letter written by the agency with a photograph of the child stating that the child belongs to you.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Congratulations, the process is now done!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Costs</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As per law the costs that you required to pay agency include only the cost of bringing up the baby at the agency (food and medical costs) and the lawyers and court fees applicable. The agency is not allowed to solicit any extra money.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I would recommend that once your process is complete, depending on your means, you do make a donation. Most agencies have children in their orphanages that do not get adopted because of some medical condition and your money would go a long way in supporting them or allowing them to keep additional children.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Post-adoption process:</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After adoption you need to file quarterly reports for the first two years and then six-monthly for a few more years after that. Make sure that your investments continue as per the court order.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In many places (like schools, colleges) you need the birth certificate of a child as proof. However no birth certificate is issued as part of the regular adoption process. You are supposed to use the photo-id and the court order instead. This is a pain in many places firstly because not every institution knows about it and secondly the child starts feeling different.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Some municipal bodies have started issuing their standard birth certificates to adopted children as well. Talk to your agency as well as the local municipal commissioner and try hard to get one. We are just in the process of starting the process with the Pune Municipal Corporation and will update this post if and when we are succesful!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Notes</h4>\r\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">This      document is mainly for Indian parents adopting in India.

Each agency has its own list of documents, but in general you will need identity and financial proofs, references from friends, undertaking from a close relative (to take care of the child in case both parents die early). Also there will be forms that each agency has that each parent fills in. This lets the agency understand your background and upbringing and also makes you think about the choices you have for your adopted baby.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A sample list is provided towards the end of this post.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Wait</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After filing the paperwork with the agency, you get on to their queue. The waiting period depends on various factors: the agency you chose and whether you are applying for a boy, girl or either. Waits tend to be from two months to well over a year. This is one factor for many in a choice of an agency: if you are in a hurry you would go for an agency with a shorter waitlist. If you don\'t mind the wait or would prefer it to keep a gap between an existing child a longer wait is fine.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You don\'t have much to do during the wait. The agency completes some formalities like a home visit. It also holds interviews and counseling to talk to you about your backgrounds, preparedness as parents and awareness of issues dealing with adoption. You should be frank in these meetings and also ask any questions you may have. Some agencies also have mandatory workshops with prospective parents where senior staff and specialists participate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Adoption</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When a baby that meets your criteria is available and it is your turn in the list you get called to see the baby. You get to see the child\'s medical records and possibly some background information. Please do take the child to a pediatrician and get all the tests they suggest, so you are also comfortable with the health of the baby.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Once you accept the baby it takes a few days for the foster-care agreements to be ready. Then you can take the baby home. Until the court okays the adoption you are foster-parents for the baby. At this time, you also apply through the agency lawyers to the court for becoming legal parents.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The court then sets a date for a “hearing” where you have to meet the judge along with the baby and the social worker and lawyer. The time of the actual hearing date after applying to the court depends on the judge, his load and some luck! It could be anywhere from four to eight months.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During this period you have to submit monthly reports of the baby to the agency and possibly physically visit the agency periodically.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the hearing the judge will ask you to make some investments on the child’s behalf based on your family income. Usually it includes an insurance policy and/or some recurring savings deposit policy in the name of the child.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You then draw up an agreement on stamp paper with the agency which is the formal request to the judge for adoption. This needs to be registered at a Registrar’s office (same place where you register rent agreements and land sale!) where they take your photographs and thumbprints.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The judge also passes an order (“Court Order”) to the effect that you are now officially the parents. When you have the investments done you should give a copy to the lawyer and he submits it as proof to the court.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You also get a “photo-id” for the child. This is a letter written by the agency with a photograph of the child stating that the child belongs to you.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Congratulations, the process is now done!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Costs</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As per law the costs that you required to pay agency include only the cost of bringing up the baby at the agency (food and medical costs) and the lawyers and court fees applicable. The agency is not allowed to solicit any extra money.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I would recommend that once your process is complete, depending on your means, you do make a donation. Most agencies have children in their orphanages that do not get adopted because of some medical condition and your money would go a long way in supporting them or allowing them to keep additional children.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Post-adoption process:</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After adoption you need to file quarterly reports for the first two years and then six-monthly for a few more years after that. Make sure that your investments continue as per the court order.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In many places (like schools, colleges) you need the birth certificate of a child as proof. However no birth certificate is issued as part of the regular adoption process. You are supposed to use the photo-id and the court order instead. This is a pain in many places firstly because not every institution knows about it and secondly the child starts feeling different.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Some municipal bodies have started issuing their standard birth certificates to adopted children as well. Talk to your agency as well as the local municipal commissioner and try hard to get one. We are just in the process of starting the process with the Pune Municipal Corporation and will update this post if and when we are succesful!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Notes</h4>\r\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">This      document is mainly for Indian parents adopting in India. For      foreigners your agency would be in your country and they would tie up      with an Indian agency.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">This      is India:      unfortunately there are two laws under which you can adopt based on your      birth religion. Hindus adopt under the HAMA (Hindu Adoption and Maintenance      Act) where you become the \"legal parents\" of the child. Other      religions come under the GAWA (Guardianship And Welfare Act) where you are      \"legal guardians\" of the child. For all practical purposes these      don\'t make a difference. Inheritance of family property and assets are the      only place it is affected, but regardless of which act you adopt under you      should write up your wills so there is no ambiguity (especially if you      also have biological children).Hopefully this discrimination will be removed soon.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">It is      also possible for single mothers and single fathers to adopt (single men can only adopt sons).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">If it      is a first child you can choose to adopt either a boy, girl or say you      don\'t mind either. However if it is a second child, usually you can only      adopt one of the other sex. (Well technically you can adopt another of the      same sex, but then the second baby will always be under GAWA regardless of      your religion).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Sample List of documents:</h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">All copies need to be attested by a notary. Notaries are available at civil or criminal courts and usually charge between Rs 5 to Rs 10 per signature. Many of the documents need to be in the format specified by the agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"0in;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Passport      copies</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Three      letters of reference given by close friends (not relatives) who have known      you for over five years, preferably with children of their own. The letter      needs to say how the referrer knows you and that s/he thinks you are      suitable as parents for adoption</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">An      undertaking on stamp paper which is also notarised, by a married relative      couple (ideally a brother/sister and their spouse) saying that they will      bring up your adopted child in case of your untimely death.</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Medical      certificates</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Proof of financial status (income tax statements, bank statements)</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Police      Verification</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Links</h4>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li> <a href=\"http://www.adoptionindia.nic.in/\">Central Adoption Resources Agency</a>: The regulatory body in India that deals with all matters relating to adoption.</li>\r\n	<li> <a href=\"http://www.bsskindia.org/\">Bharatiya Samaj Seva Kendra: Pune based adoption agency</a></li>\r\n</ol>','Adopting a child in India',0,'','inherit','open','open','','147-revision-10','','','2009-01-12 05:44:03','2009-01-12 12:44:03','',147,'http://www.rightprocedure.com/?p=159',0,'revision','',0),(160,3,'2008-12-18 08:10:36','2008-12-18 15:10:36','<span>After recent unfortunate incidents in Pune, it has become mandatory for house owners to submit tenant information.</span>\r\n<span> </span>\r\n<span>It is not very clear as to what action the police take, if someone does not submit this information but looking at the incidents, primarily the Mumbai terror attacks, it becomes a responsibility on our part and a compulsory safety measure for the Police.

I think doing it yourself should be much better as it does gives you experience of working with government offices. also after doing all hard work while getting NOC from hyd, I thought this should be miniscule task. so Wanted to do it myself.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After enquiring further, I came to know that person called Mr. Pazze handles all matters about vehicle outside Maharashtra, So I went to him and He handed me a document listing all the following. He is key person in carrying out this whole work. He will describe you whole procedure with very cool head and seems to be quite nice guy.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>NOC from original state where vehicle belongs(in my case Hyd, AP). 2 copies original</li>\r\n	<li>RC book original, registration card</li>\r\n	<li>Vehicle Insurance</li>\r\n	<li>Invoice receipt - vehicle purchase dealer receipt</li>\r\n	<li>Entry tax , in case when you bring the vehicle before 30 months of registration date.</li>\r\n	<li>Address proof where you are staying currently with photo</li>\r\n	<li>Affidavit of non-stolen vehicle by registered owner</li>\r\n	<li>Form. No 26,27, 20,33 . you will get these forms free at rto.</li>\r\n	<li>Pencil chassis print - 5 original</li>\r\n	<li>NOC from Police Commisioner pune.</li>\r\n	<li>Registration fee- 320</li>\r\n	<li>7 % for invoice cost as registration</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nYou can refund previous paid tax by applying at Hydrabad.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He asked me to get the affidavit on 20 Rs stamp paper. so I went outside, was inquiring abt affidavit, one person demanded me Rs 200 per affidavit and I asked some other person he was taking 100 Rs so I asked him to do the work. so while having conversation with him, I came to know that He also had reregistered his vehicle but through agents and in turn paid quite big amount to get the work done, he was happy knowing that I am doing work myself not through RTO agent.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In pt. 10. to get NOC from Police Commisioner pune., you need a letter from RTO. You will get this letter from Mr. Pazze, after showing him all the above docs, after verifying docs, he will give you a letter from RTO to Commissioner of police, You need to give it in Commissioner of police office with xerox of NOC from hyd, and residential proof. and after 7 working days you will get the NOC from Pune police. The concerned person is Mr. Chavan. He will issue you NOC in 10 minutes, if everything is ok.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then you need to submit all of above docs to Mr. Pazze and he will check the things and you need to get assessement done from counter 30/31( i think). then after getting how much amount you need to pay, you need to pay tax at counter 23/24 (i think..). and then re submit docs along with receipt of tax payment to Mr. Pazze. He will ask you to see him after 1 and half months.</p>\r\n\r\nSo till now, it took around 2 weeks to get this much work done.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So finally I got my docs back from RTO officer, after that I had to go to alandi office to acquire a sign from RTO officer who checks the vehicles and gives you back the paper which takes 1 hours.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now I need to give this docs back to RTO and get New maharashtra registration number and then apply for tax refund from hyderabad office.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I have written this blog in 2007. RTO procedure might have underwent some changes. if any of you go to RTO and find something is changed, I do request you to add comment or post link to your blog to help people who read this blog.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">please post comments, if you have any queries. also if you know anything more than whats written here, please let us know. we would like to hear from you.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>','Transfer of vehicle to Pune from other state ',0,'Transfer of vehicle to pune from other state and re-registration of vehicle in pune ','inherit','open','open','','22-revision-12','','','2008-12-18 08:12:02','2008-12-18 15:12:02','',22,'http://www.rightprocedure.com/?p=164',0,'revision','',0),(165,3,'2008-12-18 08:11:22','2008-12-18 15:11:22','Here we go with first article on RightProcedure.\r\n\r\nSome three years back, I moved from Hyderabad to Mumbai. I was well settled in Hyderabad so I bought a bike there.\r\nUnder some uncertain situation I permanently transferred to Mumbai office,  so I took my bike with me\r\nto Mumbai and in few months I moved to Pune since I changed my job. As these were pretty quick moves, I didn\'t get a chance to get NOC for the bike before moving out of Hyderabad.\r\nBefore moving out, though in vain, I tried to get information about getting an NOC but didn\'t get useful information on the internet. The other sources misled me into believing that NOC is not required, so I was clueless and was happily riding my bike on the streets of Pune.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nUntil one fine day, a Traffic policeman stopped me and asked for NOC. I didnt have it and he asked me to pay road tax which was Rs.4000. Obviously I couldn\'t pay that much for a small mistake (\"seemingly small\") or thing which I didn\'t know. However I settled the issue by paying him whatever money I had in my wallet (I guess, some 300 rupees). Since then I started the quest of knowing the process of getting NOC so that I can peacefully ride my bike in city.\r\n\r\nI was only left with 2 options either to sell this bike in Hyd or to obtain NOC. I didnt want to sell the bike as I loved it.\r\nMy friend in Hyderabad asked one RTO agent to do this task for me but he failed to do so. There was no option but to try it myself. I went to Hyderabad with my bike and underwent the process to obtain the NOC. After lots of rounds to various police stations and RTO offices due to wrong information, I finally got the NOC.\r\n\r\nSo here is my attempt to  throw some light on the procedure to get NOC.\r\nThe procedure is as follows:\r\n\r\n1) Get a clearance certificate from traffic police - 1 day(2-3 hrs)\r\n-- need to go to police control room, near Nampalli, Hyderabad\r\n-- police were very helpful and nice there.\r\n-- no money\r\n2) Getting the challan from E-seva office\r\n-- need a xerox of RC book\r\n-- you should know that under which police station area, your address on RC card comes since you need to mention those details on the form to be submitted to E-seva office.\r\n-- knowing Telugu will help (knowing the local language always helps)\r\n-- Rs. 100 for Hyderabad and Rs 200 for Cyberabad\r\n\r\n3) E-seva people will courier this request to police station next day\r\n-- to speed-up the process, you can get the form signed from Eseva officer and take it to police station yourself. (I did this)\r\n\r\n4) Police station people will call you once they get forms from Eseva people\r\nthey will call you for verification,\r\n-- to speed-up the process, you can also go to that Police station and ask for your form, if you want to speed up process.\r\n-- dont expect much assistance here\r\n-- they might ask you for money\r\n-- knowing Telugu will help\r\n\r\n5) In some cases,they will forward this request to ACP office for that police station\r\n6) ACP office will forward this request to Police headquarters.\r\n7) Finally you need to get the no objection certificate from Crime branch, Police\r\n8) Then you need to go to RTO for getting NOC from RTA.\r\nDocuments needed\r\n- RC book\r\n- Insurance\r\n- PUC\r\n- Police Clearance\r\n- Traffic police clearance\r\n- here it takes 2 days, if requested they will do it in a single working day.\r\n\r\nIt took me 5 working days inspite of doing everthing myself (I didn\'t wait for E-seva to courier it, I myself took the signed form to the police station) , without this urgency it should take at max 2 weeks, as police verification requires atleast 1 week.\r\n\r\nI would like to dedicate this post to some people I met during this visit, and without whose help this work would not have possible at all. I dont know their names.\r\nBut I think I wont forget them.\r\nI will call them \"few good men (and women)\", people I am mentioning are the ladies at Eseva office at Kukatpalli, then officer at Cyberabad police HQ and officer at Attapur RTA. Seeing these people do good work, my belief in good people philosophy further strengthened.  And it also redoubled my own enthusiasm to work with dedication, honesty and hardwork.\r\n\r\nSo hats of \"few good men (and women)\" :)','No objection certificate for vehicle transfer',0,'No objection certificate for vehicle transfer in hyderabad, Andhra pradesh ','inherit','open','open','','19-revision-8','','','2008-12-18 08:11:22','2008-12-18 15:11:22','',19,'http://www.rightprocedure.com/?p=165',0,'revision','',0),(166,3,'2009-01-12 06:11:51','2009-01-12 13:11:51','<em>Posted by</em>: <strong>Rahul Saxena</strong>\r\nI have Karnataka Registered bike and got caught by traffic police near  university circle.

I think doing it yourself should be much better as it does gives you experience of working with government offices. also after doing all hard work while getting NOC from hyd, I thought this should be miniscule task. so Wanted to do it myself.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After enquiring further, I came to know that person called Mr. Pazze handles all matters about vehicle outside Maharashtra, So I went to him and He handed me a document listing all the following. He is key person in carrying out this whole work. He will describe you whole procedure with very cool head and seems to be quite nice guy.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>NOC from original state where vehicle belongs(in my case Hyd, AP). 2 copies original</li>\r\n	<li>RC book original, registration card</li>\r\n	<li>Vehicle Insurance</li>\r\n	<li>Invoice receipt - vehicle purchase dealer receipt</li>\r\n	<li>Entry tax , in case when you bring the vehicle before 30 months of registration date.</li>\r\n	<li>Address proof where you are staying currently with photo</li>\r\n	<li>Affidavit of non-stolen vehicle by registered owner</li>\r\n	<li>Form. No 26,27, 20,33 . you will get these forms free at rto.</li>\r\n	<li>Pencil chassis print - 5 original</li>\r\n	<li>NOC from Police Commisioner pune.</li>\r\n	<li>Registration fee- 320</li>\r\n	<li>7 % for invoice cost as registration</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nYou can refund previous paid tax by applying at Hydrabad.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He asked me to get the affidavit on 20 Rs stamp paper. so I went outside, was inquiring abt affidavit, one person demanded me Rs 200 per affidavit and I asked some other person he was taking 100 Rs so I asked him to do the work. so while having conversation with him, I came to know that He also had reregistered his vehicle but through agents and in turn paid quite big amount to get the work done, he was happy knowing that I am doing work myself not through RTO agent.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In pt. 10. to get NOC from Police Commisioner pune., you need a letter from RTO. You will get this letter from Mr. Pazze, after showing him all the above docs, after verifying docs, he will give you a letter from RTO to Commissioner of police, You need to give it in Commissioner of police office with xerox of NOC from hyd, and residential proof. and after 7 working days you will get the NOC from Pune police. The concerned person is Mr. Chavan. He will issue you NOC in 10 minutes, if everything is ok.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then you need to submit all of above docs to Mr. Pazze and he will check the things and you need to get assessement done from counter 30/31( i think). then after getting how much amount you need to pay, you need to pay tax at counter 23/24 (i think..). and then re submit docs along with receipt of tax payment to Mr. Pazze. He will ask you to see him after 1 and half months.</p>\r\n\r\nSo till now, it took around 2 weeks to get this much work done.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So finally I got my docs back from RTO officer, after that I had to go to alandi office to acquire a sign from RTO officer who checks the vehicles and gives you back the paper which takes 1 hours.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now I need to give this docs back to RTO and get New maharashtra registration number and then apply for tax refund from hyderabad office.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I have written this blog in 2007. RTO procedure might have underwent some changes. if any of you go to RTO and find something is changed, I do request you to add comment or post link to your blog to help people who read this blog.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">please post comments, if you have any queries. also if you know anything more than whats written here, please let us know. we would like to hear from you.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>','Transfer of vehicle to Pune from other state ',0,'Transfer of vehicle to pune from other state and re-registration of vehicle in pune ','inherit','open','open','','22-revision-13','','','2009-01-12 06:08:35','2009-01-12 13:08:35','',22,'http://www.rightprocedure.com/?p=178',0,'revision','',0),(179,3,'2008-12-13 05:44:54','2008-12-13 12:44:54','<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"highslide-image\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this, {captionId:\'caption_1228340546883\'});\" href=\"http://www.rightprocedure.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/rightWay.gif\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"height: 150px;\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"http://www.rightprocedure.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/rightWay.gif\" alt=\"image\" /></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Mavens are \"information specialists\", or \"people we rely upon to connect us with new information.\"They accumulate knowledge, especially about the marketplace, and know how to share it with others.\r\n</em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- </em><strong>Tipping Point</strong></p>\r\n\r\nYes, Maven is best term is what rightprocedure wants to be, instead of Marketplace, for us it\'s LifePlace,\r\n\r\nAt Right Procedure, We are going to try our best to collect the information from various sources and put out it on web, which will avail primary source of information about tasks, give initial cues and if possible, key contact details, to start working.

My elder brother, an IIM Bangalore Alumnus, preferred to do a foreign MBA over an Indian MBA and, hence, guided me to prepare for GMAT examination. He told me to take the exam before graduating from IIT because the score remains valid for 5 years and, hence, makes sense to take the exam before getting into the corporate world. I did a one month preparation and scored just 660. I was kinda happy because I targeted 650 and I heard that above 650 is a good score. But, once I entered the job market I realized that at least 700 is a must to apply in good colleges. I was in no mood to take the exam then, so deferred it. But, importantly, I made a conscious effort to read articles, editorials seriously to improvise my grammar. I did that for almost 3 years. Truly speaking, learning grammar is a fun. There are rules, so if you know them it becomes a cake walk to spot a mistake.\r\n\r\nThen after 2 years, ie in 2006, after making a trip to California I decided to prepare for GMAT seriously. During this time, one of my very good friend, Dhruv Garg, took the exam and scored 760. I took complete advantage of him and discussed strategies to click the score. One of most important ones I remember is to take the date when one is half done with the course. Mostly people take the date first and then start preparing. Bad Idea. What one should do is familiarize oneself with the course, take some practice tests and identify how much time is needed to be completely fit for the exam. With this intention, I prepared for at least one month and then took the date keeping in mind about the limited time I had for studies. Another strategy we discussed was to never take Kaplan tests. Standard of Kaplan test is way higher than the actual GMAT standard. So, why bug yourself with difficult questions. Kaplan acts as a de-motivator.\r\n\r\nWhen I started, I felt quite comfortable in solving sentence correction and critical reasoning questions. I had some serious trouble with reading comprehension. I was scoring reasonably well in stars, biological related comprehensions, however, when it came to philosophy, humanities related comprehension I was getting screwed big time. So, I discussed this problem with my friend Dhruv and he suggested me to change my strategy to answer such types of comprehensions. I tried several strategies such as writing a line about what has happened in a particular para, writing only keywords (such as however, therefore, but etc.), reading the question first and then reading the comprehension, etc. The one that really worked was writing the keywords. Writing these keywords helped me understand the tone of the paragraph.\r\n\r\nI never spend too much time on Maths. For essay writing, I understood the basics from Official guide to GMAT and gave one week time of preparation. I referred to following books/materials for preparation:\r\n1. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Official-Guide-GMAT-Review-11th/dp/0976570904/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1235499865&amp;sr=1-1\">Official Guide to GMAT</a>\r\n2. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sentence-Correction-Preparation-Manhattan-Guides/dp/0981853366/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1235499908&amp;sr=1-1\">Manhattan Sentence Correction</a> (Awesome Book)\r\n3. 1000 questions on Sentence Correction, Reading Comprehension, Critical Reasoning (search on net)\r\n4.

I applied to 3 universities: <a href=\"http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/Programs/FullTimeMBA.aspx\">Kellogg</a>, <a href=\"http://www.isb.edu/\">ISB</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mba.nus.edu.sg/\">NUS</a>, this year and got admits from NUS and ISB. Earlier Kellogg gave me a false <a href=\"http://blog.accepted.com/acceptedcom_blog/2008/12/17/kellogg-oops-accepts-and-then-rejects-50-applicants.html\">admit</a>. It was a tough decision to choose NUS over ISB, but, after talking to so many people choosing NUS seemed to be more strategic.\r\n\r\nIn this post, I\'ll just discuss about my preparation for the GMAT exam.\r\n\r\nWell, to be frank, my journey to MBA started during my last semester in IIT Bombay. My elder brother, an IIM Bangalore Alumnus, preferred to do a foreign MBA over an Indian MBA and, hence, guided me to prepare for GMAT examination. He told me to take the exam before graduating from IIT because the score remains valid for 5 years and, hence, makes sense to take the exam before getting into the corporate world. I did a one month preparation and scored just 660. I was kinda happy because I targeted 650 and I heard that above 650 is a good score. But, once I entered the job market I realized that at least 700 is a must to apply in good colleges. I was in no mood to take the exam then, so deferred it. But, importantly, I made a conscious effort to read articles, editorials seriously to improvise my grammar. I did that for almost 3 years. Truly speaking, learning grammar is a fun. There are rules, so if you know them it becomes a cake walk to spot a mistake.\r\n\r\nThen after 2 years, ie in 2006, after making a trip to California I decided to prepare for GMAT seriously. During this time, one of my very good friend, Dhruv Garg, took the exam and scored 760. I took complete advantage of him and discussed strategies to click the score. One of most important ones I remember is to take the date when one is half done with the course. Mostly people take the date first and then start preparing. Bad Idea. What one should do is familiarize oneself with the course, take some practice tests and identify how much time is needed to be completely fit for the exam. With this intention, I prepared for at least one month and then took the date keeping in mind about the limited time I had for studies. Another strategy we discussed was to never take Kaplan tests. Standard of Kaplan test is way higher than the actual GMAT standard. So, why bug yourself with difficult questions. Kaplan acts as a de-motivator.\r\n\r\nWhen I started, I felt quite comfortable in solving sentence correction and critical reasoning questions. I had some serious trouble with reading comprehension. I was scoring reasonably well in stars, biological related comprehensions, however, when it came to philosophy, humanities related comprehension I was getting screwed big time. So, I discussed this problem with my friend Dhruv and he suggested me to change my strategy to answer such types of comprehensions. I tried several strategies such as writing a line about what has happened in a particular para, writing only keywords (such as however, therefore, but etc.), reading the question first and then reading the comprehension, etc. The one that really worked was writing the keywords. Writing these keywords helped me understand the tone of the paragraph.\r\n\r\nI never spend too much time on Maths. For essay writing, I understood the basics from Official guide to GMAT and gave one week time of preparation. I referred to following books/materials for preparation:\r\n1. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Official-Guide-GMAT-Review-11th/dp/0976570904/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1235499865&amp;sr=1-1\">Official Guide to GMAT</a>\r\n2. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sentence-Correction-Preparation-Manhattan-Guides/dp/0981853366/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1235499908&amp;sr=1-1\">Manhattan Sentence Correction</a> (Awesome Book)\r\n3. 1000 questions on Sentence Correction, Reading Comprehension, Critical Reasoning (search on net)\r\n4.

I filled up the form, attached photos (which had red background), took the originals of the documents that I was attaching. I started from my office at 10:15am. The passport office in Kormangala was 4Kms away from my office (i.e. Rs 28 auto fare). I directly went to the first floor, showed my documents in counter 1. The lady at the counter said that I need to attach 2 copies of the documents that I was attaching. I took only 1 copy - that was my FIRST mistake. I came down photo copied the documents and went back. The lady didn\'t say anything, collected all the documents (in duplicate), gave a form to fill and stapled the documents in some fixed order.\r\n\r\nI sat there waiting for my token (#93) to come. The current token that was running then at 11am was 50. I then realised that I didn\'t bring my Ration Card original. I was attaching my ration card as residence proof. That was my SECOND mistake. I took an auto from there to home and came back in the same auto (Auto Fare: Rs 120). While I was mid-way on the way to home I realised that I could have attached my voter card as residence proof, which would have costed me Rs 2 and that would have saved me Rs 118 (Rs 120 - Rs 2). That was my THIRD mistake :( Anyway as I was half-way through there was no point in going back to passport office as I had another job to do at home. By the time I reached passport office again it was 11:50am and the current token that was running then was #112.\r\n\r\nAnyway I went to the counter 1 and showed them the form. That person said that I need to change the photo as the background was red. That was the FOURTH mistake. Anyway I had 4 old photos with white background. I replaced the photos with red background by old photos with white background.\r\n\r\nThe same person said that ration card is no longer being accepted as Residence Proof. This was a sad news for me :( Attaching Ration card was another mistake (FIFTH). I asked if they can accept my voter card, he asked me to show it. When I showed the voter card he told me that it\'s not valid as it was issued in March 2009 and the criteria for voter card to be accepted as residence proof is that the card should have been issued 1 year ago. I asked him what other options do I have? He said that you can show your bank statement. I was having an ICICI bank which was having my old Pune\'s address :( My current salary account is with Citibank and to get a statement from the bank would take atleast 2 days, which I don\'t have as my passport was very soon going to be expired. I cannot show the electricity bill as it\'s in the name of the landlord and they are not willing to take the rental agreement as residence proof. <span style=\"font-size: 100%;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana;\">I cannot show the gas connection too as I got it recently in April 2009. </span></span><span style=\"font-size: 100%;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana;\">The last option that was left with me was the office\'s letter, which they thankfully said that it would work.

He checked all the documents. Took the form and said that they would call me. I sat there for 5 minutes when a lady at the cash counter called my name, I paid her the amount of Rs 1000.

I filled up the form, attached photos (which had red background), took the originals of the documents that I was attaching. I started from my office at 10:15am. The passport office in Kormangala was 4Kms away from my office (i.e. Rs 28 auto fare). I directly went to the first floor, showed my documents in counter 1. The lady at the counter said that I need to attach 2 copies of the documents that I was attaching. I took only 1 copy - that was my FIRST mistake. I came down photo copied the documents and went back. The lady didn\'t say anything, collected all the documents (in duplicate), gave a form to fill and stapled the documents in some fixed order.  I sat there waiting for my token (#93) to come. The current token that was running then at 11am was 50. I then realised that I didn\'t bring my Ration Card original. I was attaching my ration card as residence proof. That was my SECOND mistake. I took an auto from there to home and came back in the same auto (Auto Fare: Rs 120). While I was mid-way on the way to home I realised that I could have attached my voter card as residence proof, which would have costed me Rs 2 and that would have saved me Rs 118 (Rs 120 - Rs 2). That was my THIRD mistake :( Anyway as I was half-way through there was no point in going back to passport office as I had another job to do at home. By the time I reached passport office again it was 11:50am and the current token that was running then was #112.  Anyway I went to the counter 1 and showed them the form. That person said that I need to change the photo as the background was red. That was the FOURTH mistake. Anyway I had 4 old photos with white background. I replaced the photos with red background by old photos with white background.  The same person said that ration card is no longer being accepted as Residence Proof. This was a sad news for me :( Attaching Ration card was another mistake (FIFTH). I asked if they can accept my voter card, he asked me to show it. When I showed the voter card he told me that it\'s not valid as it was issued in March 2009 and the criteria for voter card to be accepted as residence proof is that the card should have been issued 1 year ago. I asked him what else options do I have? He said that you can show your bank statement. I was having an ICICI bank which was having my old Pune\'s address :( My current salary account is with Citibank and to get a statement from the bank would take atleast 2 days, which I don\'t have as my passport was very soon going to be expired. I cannot show the electricity bill as it\'s in the name of the landlord and they are not willing to take the rental agreement as residence proof. <span style=\"font-size: 85%;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana;\">I cannot show the gas connection too as I got it recently in April 2009. </span></span><span style=\"font-size: 85%;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana;\">The last option that was left with me was the office\'s letter, which they thankfully said that it would work.

Went directly to the counter 1 for verification of the documents, there was a big line. So I went to the counter 2 directly where the online application forms are being collected. He checked all the documents. Took the form and said that they would call me. I sat there for 5 minutes when a lady at the cash counter called my name, I paid her the amount of Rs 1000. She printed a cancelled stamp on the passport and handed the passport to me with a receipt.

Actually it should be the other way round - a constable should come for verification to verify the address but in India it\'s the other way round :-( Anyway I took ration card, gas connection, voter card, company letter (original + photo copy) along with 2 passport photos. The same thing happened as with the passport. They accepted my company letter and rejected all the rest for the same reasons as mentioned above. Don\'t forget to take 2 passport size photographs. At the police station the constable filled up a form, took my 2 passport photos and signature on a letter saying that I have been staying at my current address for more than 2 years.

I asked him what else options do I have? He said that you can show your bank statement. I was having an ICICI bank which was having my old Pune\'s address :( My current salary account is with Citibank and to get a statement from the bank would take atleast 2 days, which I don\'t have as my passport was very soon going to be expired.

I filled up the form, attached photos (which had red background), took the originals of the documents that I was attaching. I started from my office at 10:15am. The passport office in Kormangala was 4Kms away from my office (i.e. Rs 28 auto fare). I directly went to the first floor, showed my documents in counter 1. The lady at the counter said that I need to attach 2 copies of the documents that I was attaching. I took only 1 copy - that was my FIRST mistake. I came down photo copied the documents and went back. The lady didn\'t say anything, collected all the documents (in duplicate), gave a form to fill and stapled the documents in some fixed order.\n\nI sat there waiting for my token (#93) to come. The current token that was running then at 11am was 50. I then realised that I didn\'t bring my Ration Card original. I was attaching my ration card as residence proof. That was my SECOND mistake. I took an auto from there to home and came back in the same auto (Auto Fare: Rs 120). While I was mid-way on the way to home I realised that I could have attached my voter card as residence proof, which would have costed me Rs 2 and that would have saved me Rs 118 (Rs 120 - Rs 2). That was my THIRD mistake :( Anyway as I was half-way through there was no point in going back to passport office as I had another job to do at home. By the time I reached passport office again it was 11:50am and the current token that was running then was #112.\n\nAnyway I went to the counter 1 and showed them the form. That person said that I need to change the photo as the background was red. That was the FOURTH mistake. Anyway I had 4 old photos with white background. I replaced the photos with red background by old photos with white background.\n\nThe same person said that ration card is no longer being accepted as Residence Proof. This was a sad news for me :( Attaching Ration card was another mistake (FIFTH). I asked if they can accept my voter card, he asked me to show it. When I showed the voter card he told me that it\'s not valid as it was issued in March 2009 and the criteria for voter card to be accepted as residence proof is that the card should have been issued 1 year ago. I asked him what other options do I have? He said that you can show your bank statement. I was having an ICICI bank which was having my old Pune\'s address :( My current salary account is with Citibank and to get a statement from the bank would take atleast 2 days, which I don\'t have as my passport was very soon going to be expired. I cannot show the electricity bill as it\'s in the name of the landlord and they are not willing to take the rental agreement as residence proof. <span style=\"font-size: 100%;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana;\">I cannot show the gas connection too as I got it recently in April 2009. </span></span><span style=\"font-size: 100%;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana;\">The last option that was left with me was the office\'s letter, which they thankfully said that it would work.

I filled up the form, attached photos (which had red background), took the originals of the documents that I was attaching. I started from my office at 10:15am. The passport office in Kormangala was 4Kms away from my office (i.e. Rs 28 auto fare). I directly went to the first floor, showed my documents in counter 1. The lady at the counter said that I need to attach 2 copies of the documents that I was attaching. I took only 1 copy - that was my FIRST mistake. I came down photo copied the documents and went back. The lady didn\'t say anything, collected all the documents (in duplicate), gave a form to fill and stapled the documents in some fixed order.\r\n\r\nI sat there waiting for my token (#93) to come. The current token that was running then at 11am was 50. I then realised that I didn\'t bring my Ration Card original. I was attaching my ration card as residence proof. That was my SECOND mistake. I took an auto from there to home and came back in the same auto (Auto Fare: Rs 120). While I was mid-way on the way to home I realised that I could have attached my voter card as residence proof, which would have costed me Rs 2 and that would have saved me Rs 118 (Rs 120 - Rs 2). That was my THIRD mistake :( Anyway as I was half-way through there was no point in going back to passport office as I had another job to do at home. By the time I reached passport office again it was 11:50am and the current token that was running then was #112.\r\n\r\nAnyway I went to the counter 1 and showed them the form. That person said that I need to change the photo as the background was red. That was the FOURTH mistake. Anyway I had 4 old photos with white background. I replaced the photos with red background by old photos with white background.\r\n\r\nThe same person said that ration card is no longer being accepted as Residence Proof. This was a sad news for me :( Attaching Ration card was another mistake (FIFTH). I asked if they can accept my voter card, he asked me to show it. When I showed the voter card he told me that it\'s not valid as it was issued in March 2009 and the criteria for voter card to be accepted as residence proof is that the card should have been issued 1 year ago. I asked him what other options do I have? He said that you can show your bank statement. I was having an ICICI bank which was having my old Pune\'s address :( My current salary account is with Citibank and to get a statement from the bank would take atleast 2 days, which I don\'t have as my passport was very soon going to be expired. I cannot show the electricity bill as it\'s in the name of the landlord and they are not willing to take the rental agreement as residence proof. <span style=\"font-size: 100%;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana;\">I cannot show the gas connection too as I got it recently in April 2009. </span></span><span style=\"font-size: 100%;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana;\">The last option that was left with me was the office\'s letter, which they thankfully said that it would work. So finally I am gonna show my office letter as residence proof :) I came to office and placed a request for 2 copies of employment proof.</span></span>\r\n\r\nI took another appointment for 19 Nov 2009 on 18 Nov and I got it at 9:41am (token # 11). Lets wait and see if I still face any more problem... Shall update this blog on 19 Nov 2009.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Here\'s the update from 19 Nov 2009</span>: I reached the Passport office on 19 Nov at 9:35am starting from my office at 9:15am. Went directly to the counter 1 for verification of the documents, there was a big line. So I went to the counter 2 directly where the online application forms are being collected. He checked all the documents. Took the form and said that they would call me. I sat there for 5 minutes when a lady at the cash counter called my name, I paid her the amount of Rs 1000. She printed a cancelled stamp on the passport and handed the passport to me with a receipt. This receipt contained the file number which you can use to check the online status at <a href=\"http://rpobangalore.gov.in/npassport.asp\">http://rpobangalore.gov.in/npassport.asp</a>.\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 100%;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana;\">\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Here\'s the update from 24 Nov 2009</span>: </span></span><span style=\"font-size: 100%;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana;\">My neighbour (whose contact details I had provided in the renewal form) got a call on 23 Nov 2009 and asked me to come to the station for address proof verification. Actually it should be the other way round - a constable should come for verification to verify the address but in India it\'s the other way round :-(\r\nAnyway I took ration card, gas connection, voter card, company letter (original + photo copy) along with 2 passport photos. The same thing happened as with the passport. They accepted my company letter and rejected all the rest for the same reasons as mentioned above. Don\'t forget to take 2 passport size photographs. At the police station the constable filled up a form, took my 2 passport photos and signature on a letter saying that I have been staying at my current address for more than 2 years. That\'s all for now...

I applied to 3 universities: <a href=\"http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/Programs/FullTimeMBA.aspx\">Kellogg</a>, <a href=\"http://www.isb.edu/\">ISB</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mba.nus.edu.sg/\">NUS</a>, this year and got admits from NUS and ISB. Earlier Kellogg gave me a false <a href=\"http://blog.accepted.com/acceptedcom_blog/2008/12/17/kellogg-oops-accepts-and-then-rejects-50-applicants.html\">admit</a>. It was a tough decision to choose NUS over ISB, but, after talking to so many people choosing NUS seemed to be more strategic.\r\n\r\nIn this post, I\'ll just discuss about my preparation for the GMAT exam.\r\n\r\nWell, to be frank, my journey to MBA started during my last semester in IIT Bombay. My elder brother, an IIM Bangalore Alumnus, preferred to do a foreign MBA over an Indian MBA and, hence, guided me to prepare for GMAT examination. He told me to take the exam before graduating from IIT because the score remains valid for 5 years and, hence, makes sense to take the exam before getting into the corporate world. I did a one month preparation and scored just 660. I was kinda happy because I targeted 650 and I heard that above 650 is a good score. But, once I entered the job market I realized that at least 700 is a must to apply in good colleges. I was in no mood to take the exam then, so deferred it. But, importantly, I made a conscious effort to read articles, editorials seriously to improvise my grammar. I did that for almost 3 years. Truly speaking, learning grammar is a fun. There are rules, so if you know them it becomes a cake walk to spot a mistake.\r\n\r\nThen after 2 years, ie in 2006, after making a trip to California I decided to prepare for GMAT seriously. During this time, one of my very good friend, Dhruv Garg, took the exam and scored 760. I took complete advantage of him and discussed strategies to click the score. One of most important ones I remember is to take the date when one is half done with the course. Mostly people take the date first and then start preparing. Bad Idea. What one should do is familiarize oneself with the course, take some practice tests and identify how much time is needed to be completely fit for the exam. With this intention, I prepared for at least one month and then took the date keeping in mind about the limited time I had for studies. Another strategy we discussed was to never take Kaplan tests. Standard of Kaplan test is way higher than the actual GMAT standard. So, why bug yourself with difficult questions. Kaplan acts as a de-motivator.\r\n\r\nWhen I started, I felt quite comfortable in solving sentence correction and critical reasoning questions. I had some serious trouble with reading comprehension. I was scoring reasonably well in stars, biological related comprehensions, however, when it came to philosophy, humanities related comprehension I was getting screwed big time. So, I discussed this problem with my friend Dhruv and he suggested me to change my strategy to answer such types of comprehensions. I tried several strategies such as writing a line about what has happened in a particular para, writing only keywords (such as however, therefore, but etc.), reading the question first and then reading the comprehension, etc. The one that really worked was writing the keywords. Writing these keywords helped me understand the tone of the paragraph.\r\n\r\nI never spend too much time on Maths. For essay writing, I understood the basics from Official guide to GMAT and gave one week time of preparation. I referred to following books/materials for preparation:\r\n1. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Official-Guide-GMAT-Review-11th/dp/0976570904/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1235499865&amp;sr=1-1\">Official Guide to GMAT</a>\r\n2. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sentence-Correction-Preparation-Manhattan-Guides/dp/0981853366/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1235499908&amp;sr=1-1\">Manhattan Sentence Correction</a> (Awesome Book)\r\n3. 1000 questions on Sentence Correction, Reading Comprehension, Critical Reasoning (search on net)\r\n4. ETS and PowerPrep Tests (I scored 720 and 740 in 2 ETS tests)\r\n\r\nThis was my strategy to crack GMAT and in the end it worked out pretty well. Scoring 750 and 5.5 (essays) was something I never thought of, but then while I was writing the test I got the feeling that I would score more than 700.','MBA journey Part 1',0,'','inherit','open','open','','208-revision-6','','','2009-03-23 21:35:31','2009-03-24 04:35:31','',208,'http://www.rightprocedure.org/?p=246',0,'revision','',0),(247,3,'2010-01-15 22:24:02','2010-01-16 05:24:02','<strong>posted by</strong>: <em>Ravikanth</em>, reposted from his blog.h\r\n\r\n<span><span>I booked a bus e-ticket for my wife from Chennai to Bangalore by the KSRTC at their <a href=\"http://ksrtc.in/\">website</a>.

I wanted to book Tatkal ticket for my wife from Vizianagaram to Chennai for 11 May by the Howrah Express. Before that let me give the timing details of the train:\r\n\"<span>This train leaves each day from Howrah at 23:30hrs and reaches Vizianagaram the next day at 12:30hrs i.e Vizianagaram is 13hrs journey from Howrah.</span>\"</span></span>\r\n\r\nIf you are booking <span>a normal ticket</span> (not tatkal) you can mention the Starting station and Boarding station as Vizianagaram. In which case you have to give the date as 11 May as you want to board the train on 11 May at Vizianagaram <span>i.e. the same date as the day of journey from the boarding point</span> i.e. you are catching the train which starts from Horwah on 10 May at 23:30 and reaches Vizianagaram on 11 May at 12:30hrs.\r\n\r\nIf you are booking <span>a Tatkal ticket</span>, then you cannot give the starting station as Vizianagaram as it\'s an intermediate station and in tatkal you have to book from starting station to end station. So you have to give the starting station as Howrah and Boarding station as Vizianagaram. You have to give the date as 10 may (and not 11 May unlike above) <span>i.e. the date of the departure from the source station and not the date of the boarding station</span>. I made a mistake here. I thought that as like normal ticket we give the date of the departure from the boarding station. I gave the date as 11 may and which gave me the ticket for the train which leaves Howrah on 11 May at 23:30hrs and arrives Vizianagaram on 12 May at 12:30hrs :-( Also the tatkal reservation starts 5 days (excluding the date of journey from the origin station and not from the intermediate station).\r\n\r\n<span>Summary:</span>\r\n1) <span>For normal reservation</span> - you can give the source station and boarding station as the one from where you are boarding (i.e. Vizianagaram). The date should be the same date as the date on which the train arrives at your boarding station irrespective on how many days earlier it had started from the source station.\r\n2) <span>For tatkal reservation</span> - you have to give the source station as the station from where the train starts (i.e. Howrah). You have to give the<span>boarding station</span>* as the station from where you are boarding (i.e. Vizianagaram). The date should be the date on which the train starts from the source station (i.e. 10 May from Howrah, even though the date of boarding is on 11 May at Vizianagaram) and not the date of the boarding station.\r\n\r\nNOTE: For tatkal the counter begins 5 days before, exlcuding the day from where the train starts even though you might be boarding the train the next day after the <span><span>train has started from the source station.\r\nIn the above example: if I wanted to travel on 11 May from vizianagaram, then I have to book the Tatkal ticket for 10 May Howrah to Chennai (boarding at Vizianagaram) and the tatkal counter starts from 05 May 08:00am onwards (i.e. leave 10 May (date of source station), count 5 days back - 9 May, 8 May, 7 May, 6 May, 5 May).</span></span>\r\n\r\nPS* : While booking the irctc online ticket when you enter the From station, the boarding station field is also filled and you cannot edit manually. You have to click on the small train icon next to the boarding station field, then a window would pop up with the list of intermediate stations. You need to select the required intermediate station as boarding station.

You try to negotiate in form of small bribe instead paying actual fine amount.','How not to pay a bribe to Police!',0,'','inherit','open','open','','252-revision-6','','','2011-08-23 00:06:36','2011-08-23 07:06:36','',252,'http://www.rightprocedure.org/?p=259',0,'revision','',0),(260,3,'2009-01-12 06:16:10','2009-01-12 13:16:10','<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>Posted by:</em> <strong>Sandip More</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<span>After recent unfortunate incidents in Pune, it has become mandatory for house owners to submit tenant information.</span>\r\n<span> </span>\r\n<span>It is not very clear as to what action the police take, if someone does not submit this information but looking at the incidents, primarily the Mumbai terror attacks, it becomes a responsibility on our part and a compulsory safety measure for the Police.
